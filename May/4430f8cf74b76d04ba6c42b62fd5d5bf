Brand Finance Africa’s latest report has revealed that MTN is the most valuable South African brand with a brand value of R44.8 billion. What stood out in the 2021 report was the resilience shown by South Africa’s top brands amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. The top 50 most valuable South African brands were initially forecasted to lose over R65 billion in cumulative brand value during the pandemic. However, resolve and resilience have meant the top 50 have only recorded an R8.8 billion decrease in cumulative brand value – from R471.3 billion in 2020 to R462.4 billion in 2021. This resilience is especially evident in the recovery seen on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), which returned to January 2020 levels after just 15 months. South Africa’s telecommunications sector performed well and accounted for 18% – R81.3 billion – of the ranking’s overall brand value. This year MTN marked its tenth year at the top of the rankings as the most valuable South African brand, helped by its reach across Africa and the Middle East. Vodacom was ranked second. While it trails behind MTN, the brand continues to lead in the South African market whilst slowly spreading in Africa. “For most, lockdown has increased our reliance on electronic devices to remain connected, and this will only accelerate with the introduction of 5G,” said MD of Brand Finance Africa, Jeremy Sampson. “MTN and Vodacom are perfectly placed for these developments, however smaller contenders will struggle and ultimately be squeezed out of the running.” Telkom and Cell C dropped 4 places each in the latest rankings. Telkom is now ranked at 39 (down from 35) while Cell C is ranked at 44 (down from 40).
