Investec has announced that its Visa bank cards now support digital payment wallet Apple Pay. The feature allows users to upload their card details to the Wallet app on an iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, and Apple watch to make payments from a linked bank account by tapping their device on a supported NFC terminal. This would enable users to leave their wallets at home or in the car when shopping from any retailer with tap and go contactless payment machines. To keep transactions secure, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction codes. Card numbers are not stored on the device or on Apple servers, and are never shared with merchants. It also doesnâ€™t keep transaction information that can be tied back to the user. Investec is the fourth bank in South Africa to support the payment method, after it was first launched for Absa, Discovery Bank, and Nedbank cards at the end of March. Capitec, FNB, and Standard Bank do not yet support Apple Pay, and there have been no indications from these banks on when the service would be available. To add your Investec card to Apple Pay on your particular device, follow the instructions below.
