Telkom Mobile has launched international roaming to its prepaid and top-up customers, which includes voice, SMS, and data services. Telkom said customers are now able to activate international roaming through its self-service platforms, either via the website on the self-service portal, or on USSD by dialling *180#. Android device users can also use the Telkom app to activate international roaming on their account. Andrew Dawson, executive product portfolio management at Telkom, said this development will improve their mobile subscribers’ customer experience. The service will launch in two phases: Dawson said although they have seen a significant decline in roaming traffic and revenues during the pandemic, they are ready to expand Telkom’s service offering in new markets and territories. He said the international roaming rates for prepaid customers will essentially be similar to post-paid rates. “As such, we are thrilled to introduce this proposition to our prepaid customers,” Dawson said. Telkom’s international roaming rates differ significantly from country to country and from operator to operator. On Telna in the United States, Telkom users can expect to pay R5.00 per minute for calls, R1.50 per SMS, and R2,000 per GB for mobile data. On Vodafone in Italy the price increases to between R50.00 and R100.00 per minute for calls, R10.00 per SMS, and R300,000.00 per GB for data.
