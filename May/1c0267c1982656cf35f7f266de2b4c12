The SA Post Office has issued a warning about a scam where fraudsters convince people to pay money into a fraudulent account for a package. The email states that a parcel addressed to the person is being retained because customs fees on it are outstanding. The notice entices them to click on a link which leads them to a website where they can make a payment to release the fictitious parcel. The email includes a parcel number which was not generated by the Post Office. Although the sender appears to be “ZA-post office”, the actual email address originates from a server in Germany. “Members of the public who receive the notice should delete it immediately,” the SA Post Office said. The Post Office explained that it sends customers an SMS or a collection slip when they have a parcel waiting for collection. “This parcel should be collected as soon as possible to make sure it is not returned to the sender,” it said. The Post Office highlighted that its branches have separate queues, so if you collect a parcel you will not have to queue with customers collecting a social grant. If there are customs fees payable on a parcel from abroad, the client pays the fees when they collect the parcel. The Post Office does not require the payment of any fees before the time of collection. The Post Office encouraged members of the public with any information about postal crimes to contact its toll-free crime buster hotline on 0800 020 070. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-398887" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SAPO-letter.jpg" alt="SAPO letter" width="640" height="905" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SAPO-letter.jpg 733w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SAPO-letter-283x400.jpg 283w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SAPO-letter-304x430.jpg 304w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
