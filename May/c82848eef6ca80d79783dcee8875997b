South Africans are looking for ways to supplement their income as a result of the national lockdown. One great way to make money quickly and easily is through cryptocurrency. Leading South African cryptocurrency platform OVEX is evidence of this, as it processes billions of rand in cryptocurrency trades every month and is helping many users make more money. There are three key ways that OVEX does this – detailed below. Arbitrage is one of the best techniques to make good money through cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency arbitrage involves buying coins on an exchange, and then selling them for more on more expensive exchanges. This technique exploits the different pricing of cryptocurrencies in various countries. For example – BTC/ZAR markets have traded at a premium of 4.6% on average when compared to BTC/USD markets. Another great benefit of cryptocurrency arbitrage through OVEX is that you get instant trading. This means you don’t have to worry about the value of your cryptocurrency changing between trades. Interest accounts are another great way to make passive and consistent income on the OVEX platform. You can earn as much as 18% in annualised interest, and this interest is paid out on a daily basis. They’re incredibly simple to use – all you need to do is deposit your cryptocurrency into your OVEX interest account. You will then automatically accrue interest on your investment. OVEX’s over-the-counter trading platform is ideal for high net-worth South Africans and organisations. It offers cryptocurrency investment at scale and provides unmatched execution and settlement services. The OTC trading desk is open at all hours and offers incredibly low fees, full asset support, and ultra-deep liquidity. If you are interested in any of these investment opportunities, the OVEX platform makes it easy to get your cryptocurrency investment journey started. Click here to find out more.
