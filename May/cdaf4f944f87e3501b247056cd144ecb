Investors in South African assets need a lot more convincing that the government crackdown on corruption will prove effective. The rand strengthened as much as 1% against the dollar Thursday, the best gain among 15 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Government bond prices climbed and the benchmark stock index hit a one-week high after the ruling African National Congress suspended one of its most senior officials. But market participants were muted in their enthusiasm over the move. Sidelining ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule after he defied an ultimatum to vacate his post while he stands trial on graft charges is seen as a boost to the authority of President Cyril Ramaphosa. Magashule has repeatedly challenged the South African leader, who is attempting to implement policies to revive growth in the pandemic-ravaged economy. “This progress in the fight against corruption will be well received by investors,” said Michele Santangelo, a portfolio manager at Independent Securities in Johannesburg. “However, there is some way to go and there will certainly be pushback from those corrupt parties looking to protect themselves.” “It’s rand-positive, as it should allow Ramaphosa potentially more leeway to implement economic reforms and tackle corruption, and could bolster his odds of securing a second term as ANC leader next year,” said Natalie Rivett, emerging-markets analyst.
