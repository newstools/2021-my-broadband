MultiChoice recently implemented its annual price increase for DStv, increasing the prices of its Premium, Compact Plus, and Compact packages by between 1.2% and 2.5%. Over the past year, MultiChoice has also announced several changes to its channel line-up. It shut down SABC Encore, Sundance TV, Disney XD, and Fox Life; launched ESPN and ESPN 2; and reorganised its movie channels. With all these changes, it is useful to compare the prices and available channels of MultiChoiceâ€™s DStv packages to better understand their relative value. The monthly price and number of channels in each DStv package is summarised in the table below. The total channels exclude the DStv channel (DStv 100), and the price excludes the monthly PVR Access Fee. The following table summarises the channels that are exclusive to DStv Premium subscribers. In addition to receiving all the channels on the DStv platform, Premium subscribers also receive access to Showmax (R99 per month stand-alone subscription). The following table shows the channels available to DStv subscribers on a Compact Plus package and up. DStv Premium subscribers receive all the channels available to Compact Plus subscibers. Compact Plus subscribers can add Showmax to their subscription at a 50% discount of the monthly fee (R49 per month). They can also add M-Net Movies 1, M-Net Movies 2, and fliekNET to their subscriptions for an additional R99 per month. The table below shows which channels you get with a DStv Compact subscription.
