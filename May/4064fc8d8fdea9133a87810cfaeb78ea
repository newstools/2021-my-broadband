Samsung has announced two affordable versions of its Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy A7 tablets. For the first model – the Galaxy Tab S7 Fan Edition (FE) – the company has once again taken the cue from its customers when deciding which parts and features to include. While some of its revisions may seem like significant downgrades, they make the tablet much more affordable, with a starting price of €649 (R10,900) in Germany, one of the countries where it will be available first. The refreshed model boasts the larger 12.4-inch LCD display with the same 2,560 x 1,600 resolution as on the premium Galaxy Tab S7. Its refresh rate has been cut down from 120Hz to 60Hz, however. Samsung has also scaled down on the performance side, with a Snapdragon 750G octa-core processor replacing the Snapdragon 865 in the standard model. This chip comes paired with either 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage, or 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, while a large 10,090mAh battery with support for 45MW fast charging provides long-lasting power. For taking pictures and video, the tablet features a single 8MP rear camera with autofocus support, while the front dons a 5MP lens. The Galaxy Tab S7 ships with 5G cellular connectivity as standard, while buyers also get an S Pen stylus included in the box. Four colour options will be available – Mystic Black, Mystic Silver, Mystic Green, and Mystic Pink. The second new model is the cheaper and more compact Galaxy Tab A7 Lite, which is aimed at casual tablet users and mobile gamers. It sports an 8.7-inch LCD display with 1,340 x 800 resolution, and runs on the MediaTek Helio P22T octa-core processor supported by 3GB RAM. For loud and high-quality sound, it sports dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. Storage configurations are available in 32GB and 64GB, with microSD expansion up to 1TB supported. The back of the tablet sports a metal cover and will be available in a grey or silver finish. Pricing in Europe starts at €170 (R2,865) for the Wi-Fi only model, while the entry-level LTE version carries a price tag of €200 (R3,370). South African availability, pricing, and launch dates for these two tablets are yet to be revealed.
