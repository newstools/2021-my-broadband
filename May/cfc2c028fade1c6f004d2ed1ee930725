The South African ecommerce market is developing at a rapid rate as more traditional retailers join the online market. According to the World Wide Worx report, South Africa has reached a critical juncture, with online retail accounting for 2.8% of overall retail sales – totalling R30.2 billion every year. “The most astonishing aspect of this total is that, in just two years, it has more than doubled the R14.1-billion it reached in 2018,” said World Wide Worx MD, Arthur Goldstuck. One of the key elements that have fuelled South Africa’s online market is the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was revealed that 68% of South African consumers shopped more online because of the restrictions placed on traditional brick and mortar stores. The findings also pointed out that the country’s online retail spending reduced in-store shopping by 30%. As a result, the country’s total online retail sales are expected to exceed R42 billion in 2021. The following image is from a World Wide Worx tweet that depicts how South Africa’s online revenue almost doubled from 2018 to 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-398087" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WWW-tweet-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WWW-tweet-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WWW-tweet-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WWW-tweet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WWW-tweet.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In the increasingly crowded ecommerce market, gaining market share is difficult. One of the easiest ways to attract customers is through regular promotions. Takealot, for example, has Daily Deals, a long-running Clearance Sale with up to 50% off a wide range of items, and an upcoming 10th Birthday sale which starts on 24 May. Makro, on the other hand, is running its Buyers Choice sale, which offers discounts on a variety of products such as TVs, gadgets, and printers. MyBroadband has compiled a list of the best tech deals from well-known retailers like Takealot, Incredible Connection, Makro, Everyshop, and Brand Hubb.
