Eskom will implement Stage 1 load-shedding on Wednesday evening due to a shortage of generation capacity. Load-shedding will start at 17:00 and last until 22:00, the utility stated. “This load-shedding is required as a result of a shortage in generation capacity due to breakdowns and delays in returning units to service,” Eskom stated. This resulted in the unplanned unavailability of 14,719MW of capacity, while a further 2,220MW was unavailable due to planned maintenance. “Eskom teams are working to return more generators to service as soon as possible,” the utility said. “Should the generators not return as expected, further load-shedding might be required during the week.” Below is the statement from Eskom regarding load-shedding on Wednesday evening. #POWERALERT2 Stage 1 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00 until 22:00 tonight due to shortage of generation capacity pic.twitter.com/MUtfpR98xl — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) May 26, 2021  The load-shedding warning comes after Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha’s evening peak feedback tweet on Tuesday showed that demand in the country had exceeded Eskom’s generation capacity for the second day in a row. On Monday night, total peak demand reached 32,251MW, while Eskom only had 31,398MW of available generation. This situation deteriorated by the following night, with total peak demand in the country hitting 32,846MW, while Eskom only had 31,278MW of capacity. Fortunately, IPPs provided a further generation capacity, while Eskom also had to use its own open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs), IPP OCGTs, its Virtual Power Station mechanism, and interruptible load supply to stave of load-shedding.
