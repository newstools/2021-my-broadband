HP recently announced a new range of gaming laptops, including a budget-friendly alternative to its Omen gaming range. The budget laptop in HP’s new range is called “Victus by HP”, and will be a 16.1-inch machine with a variety of options to suit the needs of different consumers. Customers will have a choice between a FHD (1080p) display with a 144Hz refresh rate, or a more premium QHD (1440p) display with a 165Hz refresh rate. Both display options will have a 3 millisecond response time. In terms of graphics, users will be able to customise the laptop up to Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics. HP has indicated that the lower spec version will feature either Nvidia’s new budget RTX 3050 Ti GPU, or AMD’s Radeon RX 5500M GPU. The Victus sound system will be powered by Bang & Olufsen, and the keyboard will support 4-zone RGB backlighting. HP is catering to Intel and AMD supporters, with the Victus having an option for either Intel 11th Gen Core i7-11800H series processors or AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H Mobile Processors. The Victus 16 will support up to 32GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory as well as have dual 1TB NVMe SSD capacity. It will also have Thunderbolt 4 support, a feature that even some premium laptops lack. In its announcement, HP stated that the new Victus laptop range is “created to introduce gamers to an accessible, yet elevated, gaming experience”. Pricing will start at $799 (R11,125) in the US. Considering the wide range of spec options to choose from it seems more likely that the baseline $799 model of the Victus will be deemed a budget machine, whereas higher specs will see it veer more towards the price and performance range of HP’s more premium Omen laptop series. Below are the specifications and images of the Victus. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-398261" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-Front-1-640x430.jpg" alt="HP Victus 16 Front" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-Front-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-Front-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-Front-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-398263" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-side-1-640x430.jpg" alt="HP Victus 16 side" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-side-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-side-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-side-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-398259" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-back-1-640x430.jpg" alt="HP Victus 16 back" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-back-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-back-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-back-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-398265" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-sides-1-640x430.jpg" alt="HP Victus 16 sides" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-sides-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-sides-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP-Victus-16-sides-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Victus is set to release in June 2021, along with new Omen 16-inch and Omen 17-inch models. The Omen 16 will be a more immediate successor to the Omen 15, and can be ordered with up to an RTX 3070 GPU. As with the Victus model, the Omen 16 will feature a 4-zone RGB backlit keyboard, as well as a Bang & Olufsen sound system. It will also have both Intel and AMD CPU options, with the Intel option being the same 11th Gen Core i7-11800H as the more budget-oriented Victus model, and the AMD option being the chipmaker’s top of the line Ryzen 9 5900HX laptop CPU. Pricing in the US will start at $1,049 (R14,640) for the Omen 16.

As opposed to the 4-zone RGB backlit keyboard of the two 16-inch models, the keyboard on the Omen 17 will feature per-key RGB backlighting. The 17-inch model will also have speakers by Bang & Olufsen. As with the Victus, the Omen 17 will have both a QHD and a FHD display option, with the FHD featuring a 144Hz refresh rate and 7ms response time, and the QHD option featuring 165Hz and 3ms. Pricing in the US for the Omen 17 will start at $1,369 (R19,100).
