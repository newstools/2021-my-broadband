South Africans are spoiled for choice when it comes to streaming video services. Netflix, Showmax, and Amazon Prime Video each offer thousands of great movies and series to South African viewers. Aside from these big players, South Africans also have access to Apple TV+, Mubi, Crunchyroll, and Acorn TV. There are also smaller local services available like Vodacom Video Play, Telkom ONE, and DEOD. One noteworthy absence from the South African market is Disney+. There is still no legal way to watch shows like The Mandalorian, WandaVision, and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in South Africa. With shows and films are scattered across the major platforms, many households choose not to pay for three or four streaming services every month. Deciding which platforms to subscribe to will depend on where the shows and movies you want to watch are available, and the features that are important to you. If you want to watch documentaries and other premium content in ultra high definition, then Netflix is the only game in town. For streaming live football matches and 24-hour news channels like SABC News and Newzroom Afrika, you will have to subscribe to Showmax Pro. Are you interested in streaming live football matches?
