Samsung has opened pre-orders for its 2021 Neo QLED 4K and 8K TVs in South Africa which were first announced in January. The new 2021 Neo QLED TVs deliver better visuals and sport a near bezel-less screen in a slim design. The most notable change in terms of display capabilities is Samsung’s use of Quantum Mini LEDs – which are 1/40th the height of a conventional LED – for improved backlighting. “Instead of using a lens to disperse light, and a package to fix the LED in place, the Quantum Mini LED has incredibly thin micro layers filled with many more LEDs,” Samsung said. This allows for a greater range of dimming zones, which enables ultra-fine and precise control of more densely packed LEDs to prevent blooming. “Neo QLED increases the luminance scale to 12-bit with 4096 steps. This helps make dark areas darker and bright areas brighter, resulting in a more precise and immersive HDR experience,” Samsung said. In addition, the sets boast Samsung’s proprietary Neo Quantum Processor with enhanced upscaling capabilities. “By using up to 16 different neural network models, each trained in AI upscaling and deep learning technology, the Neo Quantum Processor can optimise picture quality to 4K and 8K picture output regardless of the input quality,” Samsung said. Other noteworthy features include: To make the best use of the new slim design, there is also a new attachable cable management system called the Slim One Connect box. This can be attached to the back of the TV, allowing for an easier install and cleaner aesthetic. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-396505" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Neo-QLED-pre-order-KV_L.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="453" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Neo-QLED-pre-order-KV_L.jpeg 1660w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Neo-QLED-pre-order-KV_L-566x400.jpeg 566w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Neo-QLED-pre-order-KV_L-608x430.jpeg 608w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Neo-QLED-pre-order-KV_L-768x543.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Neo-QLED-pre-order-KV_L-1536x1086.jpeg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Neo-QLED-pre-order-KV_L-1200x849.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> All pre-orders for the Samsung Neo QLED TV placed between 3-31 May 2021 will include a free Samsung Sound Bar and Samsung Signature Service accredited in-home installation service .
