Spotify Premium is offering three months free access to qualifying South Africans, including first-time users. Spotify Premium gives subscribers access to ad-free audio streaming, on-demand playback, and podcasts. Spotify has over 70 million audio tracks and more than 2.6 million podcast titles as part of its offering. The company has now launched new offers for its free and first-time users to enjoy the benefits of a Premium account. “Starting today, Spotify Premium is offering three months free to eligible free and first time-users for the Individual Premium plan,” the company said. After the free 3-month trial period, users will start to pay R59.99 per month. They can, however, cancel at any time. The offer does not apply to Spotify Premium Student, Spotify Premium Family, and Spotify Premium Duo accounts. Former Spotify Premium subscribers who cancelled their service can now reactivate their account for R59.99 for three months. Both offers are available for the Individual Premium plan beginning today until 22 June 2021. To be eligible for the R59.99 3-month offer, subscribers must have cancelled their Premium plan on or before 26 April 2021. A valid and current payment method that is approved by Spotify is required to sign up for an account. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-398959 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spotify-offer-640x249.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="249" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spotify-offer-640x249.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spotify-offer-600x233.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spotify-offer-768x299.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spotify-offer-1200x467.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spotify-offer.jpg 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
