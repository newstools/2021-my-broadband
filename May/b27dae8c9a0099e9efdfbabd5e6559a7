President Cyril Ramaphosa has gazetted the approved salaries of top government officials for the 2021 financial year, which includes remuneration for ministers, premiers, and members of parliament. The Presidency has aligned these with recommendations made by the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers earlier this year, which recommended that there be no increase to the remuneration packages of all public office bearers. This was based on consultations with the finance and justice ministers, Lower Courts Remuneration Committee, and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. This means that the government officials will be paid the same salaries that they were last year. According to the gazette, the Deputy President, Speaker in the National Assembly, and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces are each entitled to a package of R2,825,470 for the year. Each minister will receive total remuneration of R2,401,633, while deputy ministers will receive a package of R1,977,75. The presidentâ€™s own salary must be approved by parliament. At a provincial level, premiers will receive R2,260,409 this year, while executive council members will be paid R1,977,785. At the lowest level, permanent delegates of the National Council of Provinces will receive a package of R1,137,993.
