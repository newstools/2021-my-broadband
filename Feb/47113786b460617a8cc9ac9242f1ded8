Lenovo maintained its lead in the market, with 28.8 million shipments in Q4 bringing its total for the year to 87 million units. This means its desktops, laptops, and tablets accounted for 19% of all computers sold in 2020. Second-placed Apple was short on its heels, claiming a market share of 18% with its Mac and iPad systems. A tally of 26.4 million shipments in the final quarter of 2020 brought its total shipments up to 81.4 million. Notably, this represented 23% annual growth over its shipments in 2019. HP followed in third place with a total of 67.8 million shipments, while Dell and Samsung closed off the top five with respective figures of 50.5 million and 34.5 million. The table below shows a comparison of the total number of PC shipments among the world’s top five best-selling computer brands. Google’s Chrome OS has also seen significant uptake with more than double the number of Chromebooks sold last year. “Demand for Chromebooks is through the roof,” said Canalys Research Director Rushabh Doshi. “With many countries being forced to accelerate their digital education plans in the wake of additional lockdowns, schools and universities are clamouring for easy to deploy solutions and Google’s digital offerings for education are proving quite popular over rival platforms, especially in the US and Western Europe,” Doshi stated. Shipments of Chromebooks from HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer, and Samsung climbed from 14.7 million in 2019 to 30.7 million in 2020.
