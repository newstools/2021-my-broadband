Yes, we are winning. Thank you, Mr. Elon Musk. Slowly but surely, and largely due to the publicity created by the StarLink service of SpaceX and the achievements of Elon Musk, the industry is realising that the myths of satellite – that it is slow, expensive and has a latency problem – are incorrect. Network architects are starting to realise that satellite technology is undergoing rapid development and is very much relevant today and in the future of connectivity. Architects now want to understand more about satellite – questions such as: In this discussion we will start with the first and primary criteria – what applications are ideal for satellite Internet? Asking this question is a sign you are on the right track as it is the correct approach to network design. It underlines the fundamental understanding that technologies are very different, and that each technology has pro and cons and is best suited to different applications. At the risk of over-simplification, here is a short recap of technology fundamentals as applicable to the most popular connectivity options.  Twoobii is 99.95%* *Note: Twoobii is the high-throughput satellite solution powered by the latest Intelsat platforms and operated by Q-KON – see www.twoobii.com. By integrating the listed technology characteristics with different user requirements and connectivity applications, we can generate the following application scale which visualises which technology is best suited for which application. In this example we are considering the following applications: Primary service, back-up or standby service, high availability services, SD-WAN secondary links, and on-demand applications. In this application scale, a “high” score indicates a good fit between the application and the technology, whereas a “weak” score indicates a poor fit between technology and application. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-385943 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/QKON-graph-640x338.png" alt="" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/QKON-graph-640x338.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/QKON-graph-600x316.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/QKON-graph-768x405.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/QKON-graph.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  Next fibre and lastly 3G due to the best-effort quality of service. Understanding the key characteristic of each telecommunication technology is an excellent first step to sound network architecture and designing networks with the best performance at lowest cost levels. It also demonstrates that different technologies serve different applications and that no technology offers a “one-size-fits-all” model. From this understanding it is also clear that there are major benefits to satellite services and that new HTS services like Q-KON Twoobii offers strong business benefits.
