Personal data is a valuable commodity among hackers, and there is a lucrative market based on selling private data on the dark web. According to NordVPN CTO Marijus Briedis, there are billions of personal records available to buy on the dark web and the market has become so commercialised as to even offer loyalty reward programmes. “Cybercriminals even have loyalty programs and discount systems in place ranging from 5% to 30% off for bulk purchases,” Briedis said. “The Dark web is just like Wall Street. The higher the damages the sold data can inflict, the more expensive it is.” He said that after cybercriminals obtain hacked or leaked data such as credit card details, online banking credentials, and more, they sell this information to others who may use it to steal from victims’ bank accounts or steal their identities. “Most of us have a snap of our ID or passport on our phone or cloud storage,” Briedis said. “Once leaked, it could be used to make a forged document that costs up to $1,500 if you are a citizen of the US, Canada, or Europe. Social Security numbers sell for $70 USD.” NordVPN cybersecurity researchers accessed and took screenshots of dark web marketplaces where this type of information is sold. The screenshots below show a loyalty system advertised for bulk purchases of social security numbers, as well as credit card details. The researchers found that credit card sells for as little as $1, depending on how much money the victim has in their account and how difficult it is to access it. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386870" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NordVPN-dark-web-sales.jpg" alt="NordVPN dark web sales" width="640" height="701" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NordVPN-dark-web-sales.jpg 1143w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NordVPN-dark-web-sales-365x400.jpg 365w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NordVPN-dark-web-sales-393x430.jpg 393w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NordVPN-dark-web-sales-768x841.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Dark Web Price Index provides an up-to-date reflection of the cost of private data on the dark web.
