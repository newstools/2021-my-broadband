Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga will announce the 2020 national examination results on Monday 22 February 2021. The matric examinations started on 5 November 2020 and the final papers were written on 15 December 2020. The later start, the Basic Education Department said, allowed schools and learners adequate time to cover the curriculum. Marking of the 2020 matric exams started on 4 January 2021 and involved 45,000 matric exam markers, 216 question papers, and over 10 million scripts. Umalusi, the quality council for general and further education and training, approved the release of the matric results on 15 February 2021. Umalusi CEO Mafu Rakometsi said the 2020 academic year will go down as the most challenging since the dawn of democracy in South Africa. Despite these challenges, Umalusi said there has been a marked improvement in the overall quality of question papers submitted this year. While Motshekga will unveil an overview of the matric results on Monday, learners will only receive their individual results on Tuesday 23 February. There are many ways for learners who wrote their matric exams last year to get their results, which include SMSes, online portals, and using a mobile app. The first and easiest option is for learners to get their statements of results on 23 February 2021 from their school or centre where they wrote the exams. For those who are not keen to travel to their school, they can use the methods listed below. Candidates’ partial results will be made available on the Department of Basic Education website. To get their results, learners have to visit the Department of Basic Education website and register using their examination details. This can be done by visiting the 2020 NSC exam results page and entering their examination number. The results will then appear on the screen and they can download and print them. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-165208" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Department-of-education.jpg" alt="Department of education" width="640" height="430" /> News24 has partnered with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) and the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) to bring the matric results to learners. Students who wrote the Department of Basic Education’s National Senior Certificate (NSC) can search for their results using their examination number, or by searching for their school name and then selecting their examination number. These results will be available on the matric site on Tuesday 23 February 2021, excluding the Western Cape. NSC results for the Western Cape will be released shortly afterwards. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-387284" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/News24-Matric-Results.jpg" alt="News24 Matric Results" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/News24-Matric-Results.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/News24-Matric-Results-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/News24-Matric-Results-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Sowetan Live matric portal offers learners a pre-registration service to receive their results when they are released.
