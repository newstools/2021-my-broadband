MSI recently launched its range of RTX 3000-series notebooks at a virtual event, bringing RTX 3080 performance to the mobile workstation market. While competitors have also unveiled their RTX 3000-series notebooks, these are only available on pre-order, whereas MSI’s RTX 3000-series notebooks are available right now. MSI’s line-up of RTX 3000-series notebooks spans its GE, GS, GP, and GF laptop series, with the GP76 Leopard, GS66 Stealth, and Creator 15 range now available in South Africa. Across these three models, you have the option of an RTX 3080, 3070, or 3060 GPU as well as various Intel CPU configurations. The GP76 Leopard is for those looking for a great traditional gaming laptop, while the GS66 Stealth caters to those looking for gaming performance in a business laptop form factor. The Creator 15 range is designed to fulfil the needs of even the most demanding of creators. Reflecting the growing importance of high-speed Internet connectivity, MSI’s RTX 3000-series laptops all support Wi-Fi 6E, meaning they are capable of operating in the 6GHz band. This offers faster data output for video streaming, virtual reality and other wireless experiences. MSI also unveiled its resizable BAR technology which enables the laptop’s CPU to have full access to GPU memory at all times – ultimately resulting in a 5-10% FPS increase. With its unique low-profile design, the GS66 Stealth is the perfect camouflage for business professionals who want to conceal their inner gamer. Its “Sharper in Core Black” premium design has won various awards – including an IF Design award and a Red Dot award. Between the latest GeForce RTX 3000-series GPUs and the laptop’s DLSS AI rendering technology, the GS66 Stealth enables gamers to play at a stunning 4K resolution with ray tracing and the ability to boost your framerate to over 60 FPS. The GS66 Stealth also takes advantage of the computing power of Intel’s latest processors, offering up to eight cores for better performance. This laptop comes with the Cooler Boost Trinity+ cooling system that boasts the world’s thinnest 0.1mm sharp-edged blades; an extremely smooth 300Hz IPS-level display; and another World Champion title: its 99.9Whr battery offers the most capacity available in any laptop. MSI is also dedicated to providing the best laptops for creators. To this end, the MSI Creator 15 is an excellent all-around laptop that is purposely built for the most demanding of creators. The Creator 15 is guaranteed to provide the most true-to-life visual experience thanks to features like an individually-calibrated 4K True Pixel display panel verified by Calman and a 100% AdobeRGB colour gamut. Because it is accelerated by RTX 3000 graphics, the Creator 15 speeds up video and 3D animation rendering times considerably, while a new touchscreen display provides easier navigation and an increase in productivity. The Creator 15’s 99.9Wh battery capacity and lightweight design provide ultimate mobility for remote studios.
