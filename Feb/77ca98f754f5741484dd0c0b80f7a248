Crypto has outperformed all other asset classes over recent years but it’s not just a story of Bitcoin’s growth. After increasing 100% in 2019 and 300% in 2020, Bitcoin has created more than a few millionaires, however, there are other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot and Chainlink that have far outperformed an investment in Bitcoin alone over the last 12-months. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386104" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1200x799.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Source: Revix The cryptocurrency market has started 2021 with strong momentum as corporate and institutional interest accelerate. “The next boom has begun,” according to Forbes and it is easy to see why. Many big names including Tesla, Facebook, Paypal, Blackrock, Fidelity, JP Morgan, MicroStrategy, Harvard’s endowment fund and Square as well as well known billionaire investors Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have entered the crypto space driving billions of dollars into the sector. In fact, the total market value for all cryptocurrencies increased over $1 trillion (R15 trillion, which is about 2.5x South Africa’s GDP) over the last 12-months, from $190 billion on January 1st 2020 to over $1.2 trillion today. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the largest two cryptocurrencies, make up over 70% of the whole crypto markets’ value and both have repeatedly broken all-time highs. In early February, Bitcoin broke to a new all-time high of $47 066 (around R720 000) per coin, when it was announced that Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to hold instead of dollars in its treasury. Ironically, this helped to push Bitcoin’s market value ahead of Tesla’s. These advances have crowned cryptocurrencies as the best performing investment category of the last decade with a remarkable 46,000% return on investment. This means that a R10,000 investment in the broader crypto market 10 years ago would be worth R4.6m today. “We’ve been waiting for institutional players, from payment providers to corporates to hedge funds, enter the crypto space and this is now happening at a rapid pace,” says Sean Sanders, CEO and founder of crypto investment platform Revix. Although Bitcoin remains king, Cardano (12 447%), Polkadot (+755%), Chainlink (+697%) and Ethereum (+697%) posted remarkable growth over the last 12-months. This is in part thanks to the rise in decentralised finance (DeFi), which is a subsector of the cryptocurrency industry where entrepreneurs are building semi-automated trading and lending systems atop blockchain networks. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386118" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1-1200x799.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.-12-Month-Performance-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />

The influx of capital into crypto markets comes during a time of extreme and unprecedented economic uncertainty. It marks an important shift in the public’s perception of cryptocurrencies: rather than being seen solely as a speculative asset for those looking for eye-popping returns, cryptocurrencies now maintain a much broader appeal. Ethereum’s ether token (ETH), hit an all-time high of $1,800 on the 8th of February and has pushed the market value of all the existing ether in the world to about $200 billion. At this level, it’s larger than the U.S. financial giants Wells Fargo ($135 billion) and Citigroup ($132 billion) as well as the 86-year-old Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley ($137 billion). “The comparison isn’t perfect, since Ethereum works more like a network for companies and developers to build upon rather than the companies themselves. But the exercise does point to the ecosystem’s no-longer-dismissable scale,” explains Sanders. “Ethereum has always been the lesser-known rival to Bitcoin for a mainstream audience but increased awareness and understanding of what it can offer creates more awareness causing adoption to accelerate – just like what we’ve seen with Bitcoin,” explains Sanders. Sanders continues, “As with all emerging sectors and technologies, the journey for crypto will continue to have its ups and downs. Price corrections are a natural part of any investment market and are especially natural in the crypto ecosystem. But one thing is clear: crypto has arrived, and the time to get ahead of crypto’s mainstream breakout is starting to run short. If there’s one thing we can learn from the evolution of the internet and other technologies, it’s that it just takes some time before ideas are turned into actual usable products and crypto seems to be doing just that.” If you’ve been watching this year’s crypto boom from afar, and want to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a diversified crypto basket, now’s your chance to get started today by signing up for a free account at www.revix.com.

Sign-up is free, there are no monthly fees and their friendly customer support team are there for you every step of the way. You can sell your crypto investment at any time and withdraw your funds: there are no lock-up periods like there are with other investment funds. “Buying a single cryptocurrency can be easy if you know which one to buy,” says Sean Sanders, founder and CEO of Revix. “But many people are not confident enough to know which cryptocurrency to back, so buying a Bundle – rather like an ETF or unit trust – takes the guesswork out of it and lets the winners come to you.” Buying a crypto Bundle rather than a single cryptocurrency makes owning a diversified crypto portfolio more convenient and less risky as you’re not exposed to the price fluctuations of just one crypto asset. Revix’s crypto products have produced exceptional returns. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386114" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Comparison-Graph-600x338.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Comparison-Graph-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Comparison-Graph-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Comparison-Graph-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Comparison-Graph-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Comparison-Graph-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Comparison-Graph.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386112" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.-Top10-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.-Top10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.-Top10-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.-Top10-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.-Top10-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.-Top10-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.-Top10-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Top 10 Bundle spreads your investment equally over the 10 largest cryptocurrencies – which covers about 85% of the crypto market when measured by market capitalisation – with each having a 10% weighting. By default, you are buying the 10 biggest success stories in the crypto space. The weightings are adjusted monthly to ensure no crypto exceeds a 10% weighting. This Bundle includes the top performing cryptocurrencies: Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano and Chainlink which have all significantly outperformed Bitcoin on a relative basis. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386110" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.-Payment-Bundle-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.-Payment-Bundle-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.-Payment-Bundle-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.-Payment-Bundle-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.-Payment-Bundle-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.-Payment-Bundle-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.-Payment-Bundle-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Payment Bundle holds the cryptocurrencies which aim to become cash, like rands or dollars. The Bundle provides exposure to the 5 largest payment-focused cryptocurrencies looking to compete with government-issued fiat currencies to make digital payments cheaper, faster and more global. These cryptos include Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar (XLM) and Monero (XMR). <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386108" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7.-Smart-Contract-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7.-Smart-Contract-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7.-Smart-Contract-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7.-Smart-Contract-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7.-Smart-Contract-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7.-Smart-Contract-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7.-Smart-Contract-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Smart Contract Bundle tracks the cryptocurrencies that aim to offer an open-source, public network without any downtime, fraud, control or interference from third parties. Smart Contracts use the blockchain to allow peer-to-peer transactions without the need for third party verification. This Bundle comprises cryptocurrencies like Ethereum that enable developers to build applications on top of their blockchains, much like how developers build mobile apps on top of the Apple mobile iOS operating system. The cryptos in this Bundle include Ethereum, Cardano, Tron, Neo, and EOS. Revix charges no monthly account or subscription fees, but rather a simple 1% transaction fee for both buys and sells and a 0.17% per month rebalancing fee (which amounts to 2.04% a year) on the total Bundle value held (this fee is not levied on single cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or the Pax Gold token). As the old proverb goes, “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.” It seems diversification in the rapidly changing world of crypto may be even more important than in other markets. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-386106" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8.-How-to-sign-up-600x369.png" alt="" width="640" height="393" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8.-How-to-sign-up-600x369.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8.-How-to-sign-up-640x393.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8.-How-to-sign-up-768x472.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8.-How-to-sign-up-1536x944.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8.-How-to-sign-up-2048x1259.png 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8.-How-to-sign-up-1200x738.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This article was published in partnership with Revix.
