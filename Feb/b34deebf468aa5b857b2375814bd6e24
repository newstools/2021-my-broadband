Afrihost fibre clients who use Openserve infrastructure are getting free line speed upgrades in March. Earlier this month, Openserve informed Internet service providers (ISPs) it would be implementing connection speed upgrades across its fibre and copper products from 1 March 2021. A number of low-speed Openserve connections are also being phased out of its product portfolio, and retail customers with these connections will be upgraded to the new minimum product. The speed upgrades which will kick in next month include: Afrihost CEO Gian Visser said the bill for their 200Mbps fibre clients will automatically be adjusted and they will save R380 per month from March. The speed upgrades will incur additional IPC charges for ISPs as they will have to purchase additional capacity to accommodate the higher speeds. The good news is that Afrihost will absorb this cost. “We are very happy to take this knock and give our loyal clients way more speed on their Openserve Pure Fibre for the same price,” said Visser. “2020 and 2021 have been tough years and it’s really great to be able to bring some good news to our clients,” he said.
