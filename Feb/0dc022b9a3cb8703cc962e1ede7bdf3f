Ford has launched its FordPass Connect modem and FordPass app in South Africa, allowing owners of new Ford ranger models to perform advanced command and control functionality and see relevant vehicle data on their own smartphone device. “FordPass Connect makes life simpler and easier and, as Ford South Africa’s best-selling vehicle – which is locally produced at the Silverton Assembly Plant in Pretoria – it is the first to offer this innovative technology as standard,” the company said. The full offering will be available as standard on all Ford Ranger XL, XLS, XLT, Wildtrak, FX4, and Ranger Raptor models produced from February 2021. All Rangers equipped with FordPass Connect are fitted with an embedded modem at no additional cost that pairs with the FordPass smartphone app to unlock a range of new connected services. FordPass Connect is then paired with existing vehicle infotainment systems in these models. Key features of FordPass Connect include: Other features include roadside assistance, vehicle support, a FordPass Guide service, and over-the-air updates for automatic software upgrades and enhancements.

However, the FordPass Connect modem cannot be retrofitted to add the location, command, or control functions. Ford added that other than the usage of mobile data for the user’s smartphone, there are no data costs associated with the FordPass Connect modem, which connects to the cloud via the 4G mobile network, Additional information on FordPass Connect can be found at www.ford.co.za/fordpass or by downloading the FordPass app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
