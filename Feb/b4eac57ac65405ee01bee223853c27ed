We perused the online shelves of popular South African retailers which offer a wide range of laptops, including Evetech, Wootware, Raru, Takealot, and PC Link Shop – to see which were the most expensive laptops in the country. The majority of the most expensive laptops were gaming notebooks, as their powerful GPUs often make out the most costly part of a computer. Our selection was dominated by MSI – which claimed four spots in the top 10. It offered two gaming behemoths flanked by the multimedia productivity-focused Creator 17 and WS75. Three laptops in the ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) line-up also made the cut, with two different models of the company’s Zephyrus Duo present. However, the most expensive laptop we found was not aimed at gamers but instead geared towards demanding workloads in professional environments. This was the Lenovo ThinkPad P73, a powerful mobile workstation which in this instance features an eight-core Intel Core i9 processor, Quadro RTX 4000 graphics card, and 32GB of DDR4 RAM, alongside 1TB of NVMe storage. On top of this, it also boasts a 4K IPS LCD panel for crystal clear images. This premium device comes with a hefty price tag of R100,899 from Wootware. While the laptop has been discontinued by Lenovo, Wootware still gives possible buyers the option of putting in a request for stock. Below are the top 10 most expensive laptops we could find for sale in South Africa. Note that we only included the most expensive configuration if a model was available in multiple setups. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-386902"
