MyBroadbandâ€™s Speed Test App, which is available to Android and iOS users, offers an easy way for South Africans to test their broadband speed. The app is free to download and use, is ad-free, and allows users to test the download speed, upload speed, and latency of their Internet connection. Users are also able to rate their mobile operator and Internet service provider (ISP). This data is used to rank broadband providers in South Africa. To encourage users to take the app for a spin, MyBroadband has launched a new giveaway where users can win a Huawei P40 Pro+ smartphone and cash worth R25,000.

Good news is that MTN has zero-rated the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which means MTN subscribers will not be charged for the data used when running speed tests.
