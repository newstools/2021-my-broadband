Huawei’s MateBook 14 is an awesome laptop that offers great features for both work and play. This makes it the ultimate laptop for your needs – whether you are working from home, want a laptop to surf the Internet, or are watching your favourite shows. The Huawei MateBook 14 has set a new standard in the laptop industry with its 2K FullView display. This screen has an impressive 90% screen-to-body ratio and supports 10-point multi-touch technology that you would usually only get with high-end PCs. This technology lets you take a screenshot by swiping down on the screen with three fingers, and can also convert text in screenshots into machine-encoded text for easy editing. This makes the MateBook 14 the market-leader in 14-inch laptop displays. Additionally, the display is housed in a sleek aluminum alloy body which is put through an advanced sandblasting process for a soft finish that looks and feels great. The MateBook 14 offers high-end power thanks to its powerful 11th-generation Intel Core processor. This processor, combined with up to 16GB RAM and a 512GB NVMe PCIe SSD, makes the MateBook 14 an incredibly powerful device that is capable of running the most challenging work tasks with ease. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity is another standard feature, which means you can get much faster Internet speeds, while the MateBook 14 also supports Huawei Share – a technology that makes it easy to transfer files between your Huawei devices without needing cables or third-party apps. With all of this performance, it is impressive to note the Huawei MateBook 14 supports up to 12 hours battery life. This is thanks to its 56Wh battery and intelligent energy-saving management software. You also don’t have to worry about overheating, as the Huawei MateBook 14 uses a custom shark fin fan and dual heat pipe design to keep it the perfect temperature – even when you are performing intensive tasks.
