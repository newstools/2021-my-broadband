MSI GF63 – Thin Bezel Gaming at it’s best. – Kacper Andrzejczak A computer is the most important thing in every player’s life. It’s the same for me – I always want to have it with me, and with MSI GF63 laptop it is possible. My name is Kacper, I play games every day and today I will tell you why I chose the MSI GF63. I start the day with my morning training in the League of Legends, although my laptop can easily handle more demanding titles as well. Due to the high resolution display, the picture is always sharp and clear. And I don’t worry about performance either – all thanks to the perfect duo, the high-performance NVIDIA GTX 1650 graphics card and the new 10th generation Intel Core i7 processor. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-405407" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Picture8.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> I always want to carry my laptop with me, so it must be a good travel companion.

Furthermore, the time spent on the road doesn’t go to waste – thanks to the excellent IPS-level display and long battery life, I can still use my computer. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-405409" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Picture9.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /> My gaming laptop must also assist me when I walk!

And I have MSI Centre technology at my disposal too, which will adjust energy saving and performance to the currently tasks, so as to maximize the time of work without power charging. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-405413" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Picture11.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /> However, using the computer outdoors is associated with the inconvenience of light reflections. Fortunately, I have no problem with it too. Thanks to the matte IPS-level matrix, the content displayed on the MSI GF63 notebook is always clear, even when working in the sunlight. A gaming laptop must have an excellent display, and the IPS-level matrixprovide a realistic and vivid image – no matter what angle I look at the screen. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-405415" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Picture12.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /> When I go home, I like to have a snack, but what to do when my favorite stream is already on the air?

When I sit comfortably on the couch, a laptop screen is no longer enough. Then I use Matrix Display technology!
