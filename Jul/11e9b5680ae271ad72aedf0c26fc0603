Social media in South Africa has been flooded with shocking videos and photos of violent scenes and rampant looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The unrest comes in the wake of Jacob Zuma’s imprisonment for contempt of court at the Estcourt Correctional Facility last week Wednesday. The former president’s family members and supporters have called on people to shut down the country in a bid to secure his freedom. They have claimed that Zuma was unfairly treated and sentenced to prison without trial. Under the guise of the #FreeZuma campaign, rioters have burnt down trucks, blocked roads, and raided shopping malls. The SA Police have said that 219 people had been arrested in the country for looting-related crimes by 8:30 on Monday morning, while 7 deaths have been linked to the violence. Most of the arrests were made in the hotspot of KwaZulu-Natal, where protests initially started with the blocking of major roads and highways last week. There have also been sporadic incidents in parts of Gauteng, including Hillbrow, Jeppestown, and Vosloorus. Among the most shocking scenes is video footage showing the Brookside mall in Pietermaritzburg on fire. The fire was reportedly caused by looters who had set the building alight.

The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) confirmed on Monday afternoon that it has begun pre-deployment procedures to help law enforcement agencies deployed in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. This is in line with a request for assistance received from the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (Natjoints), the SANDF said. Below are more of the videos and photos posted on social media of violent scenes across South Africa from last week and this morning.
