Comair has extended the suspension of Kulula.com and British Airways flights until 31 August 2021, following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement that South Africa will remain on lockdown level 4. Comair said the prohibition of all non-essential travel in and out of Gauteng means there is limited demand for business travel. Comair suspended all scheduled flights from 5 July 2021 with the intention to start flying again on 30 July 2021. However, given the uncertainty of the expected length of the recently adjusted level 4 lockdown, Comair decided to suspend flight operations until 31 August 2021. “This decision has been taken in the interest of the well-being of employees and customers,” Comair said. “Without Government engagement with or support for the aviation sector and associated services, the ability to plan constructively for a meaningful service beyond 30 July 2021 is exceptionally challenging.” “Taking the potential variables into consideration, Comair plans to resume scheduled operations on Wednesday 1 September 2021.” Comair CEO, Glenn Orsmond, apologised to customers affected by the suspension, adding that the decision was not made lightly. Tickets for travel with Kulula.com from 28 June 2021 to 31 August 2021 will remain valid for 12 months until 31 August 2022. No change of booking fee or fare difference will be charged.
