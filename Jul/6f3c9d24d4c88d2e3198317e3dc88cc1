The updated regulations come amid violent looting and vandalism in KwaZulu-Natal and parts of Gauteng following the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma.

Earlier today, the Presidency issued a statement on behalf of Ramaphosa saying that he has embarked on a round of consultations with leadership of different sectors of society to develop a society-wide response to the violence and destruction affecting many parts of the country.
