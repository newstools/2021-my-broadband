Apple has released the public betas for its upcoming operating system updates, including iOS 15, macOS Monterey, iPadOS 15 and WatchOS 8. The company announced the new operating systems at its annual WWDC on 7 June, and test versions have been available to developers since then. Beta versions of all the new operating systems are now available to anyone who wants to test them on the Apple Beta website. iOS 15 is available from the iPhone 6 and all devices thereafter. macOS Monterey is available from: iPadOS 15 is available from the iPad 2 and later. WatchOS 8 will run on all devices from the Apple Watch Series 3 and later. Betas tend to be buggy, and we donâ€™t recommend downloading them on your primary device. If you do, be sure to make a backup of your device before doing so. Apple provided the following instructions for how to download and install the beta software.
