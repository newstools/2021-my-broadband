Over R121 million was spent at an auction for classic video games that ran from 9 to 11 July. The item that drew the biggest bid was a sealed 1996 copy of Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64 gaming console, which sold for R22.3 million. The Video Games Signature Auction hosted by Heritage Auctions saw a total of 493 games go up for sale. From a collector’s perspective, it seems that even some relatively recent titles can already be considered modern classics. Featured games were for platforms from the original Nintendo 64 up to the more recent Xbox 360. This included games such as The Elder Scrolls, Assassin’s Creed, Grand Theft Auto, Silent Hill, and Minecraft. Numerous post-2000 titles sold for multiple times their original market value. Super Mario 64 received the highest bid, becoming the most expensive video game ever sold. A 1987 early-production unit of The Legend of Zelda took second place at R12.5 million, and a 1991 Super Mario World copy came in at third-highest, selling for R5.2 million. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-405738 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/super-mario-64.jpg" alt="super-mario-64" width="600" height="854" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/super-mario-64.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/super-mario-64-281x400.jpg 281w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/super-mario-64-302x430.jpg 302w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The most expensive game sold for the original Playstation console was a 1997 copy of Final Fantasy VII, which sold for R2.1 million.
