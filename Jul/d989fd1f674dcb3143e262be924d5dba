Dis-Chem has begun public testing of DeliverD, an online service available from its smartphone app that offers 60-minute deliveries from specific branches around the country. At the branches where the DeliverD service is available, it runs 7 days a week and Dis-Chem charges a flat delivery fee of R60 on all orders. “Dis-Chem DeliverD complements our existing online offering, and this development taps directly into understanding what our customers want, central to which is convenience,” said Saul Saltzman, executive director at Dis-Chem. “We have seen significant online growth in the past 12 months and the ongoing customer demand for quick, same-day online service was a key driver behind the introduction of this offering.” To use the service you must download the Dis-Chem app on the App Store, Google Play, or Huawei’s AppGallery. Dis-Chem said that the app offers over 7,000 products at in-store prices and that deliveries take place within 10km of a participating store. Shoppers can choose delivery time slots between 09:00 and 16:30 from Monday to Saturday, and between 09:00 and 13:00 on Sundays and public holidays, with the disclaimer that time slots are not yet at full capacity during the DeliverD’s pilot phase. For same-day delivery, you must place your order before 16:30. Orders placed after 16:30 will be scheduled for delivery the next day. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404903" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dis-Chem-DeliverD-infographic.jpg" alt="" width="1218" height="599" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dis-Chem-DeliverD-infographic.jpg 1218w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dis-Chem-DeliverD-infographic-600x295.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dis-Chem-DeliverD-infographic-640x315.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dis-Chem-DeliverD-infographic-768x378.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dis-Chem-DeliverD-infographic-1200x590.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Orders will earn Dis-Chem Benefits points, though it is not yet possible to spend points on DeliverD.
