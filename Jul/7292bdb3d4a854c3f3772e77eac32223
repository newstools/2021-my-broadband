TOP500 has released the latest edition of its supercomputer rankings, which revealed that the Japanese Fugaku is the most powerful supercomputer in the world. Riken and Fujitsu developed Fugaku, and the machine is based on Fujitsu’s custom ARM A64FX processor. It has a High-Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark score of 442 petaFLOPS per second, meaning it can perform 442 quadrillion floating-point operations per second. There was one newcomer in the top 10 — the Perlmutter system at NERSC at the DOE Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The machine is based on the HPE Cray “Shasta” platform and a heterogeneous system with both GPU-accelerated and CPU-only nodes. Perlmutter achieved 64.6 Pflop/s, putting the supercomputer at number 5 in the new list. Outside of the top 10, there were a few instances of Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2 Cloud clusters performing well. Pioneer-EUS, the computer in the number 24 spot and Pioneer-WUS2 at number 27 use Azure. The Amazon EC2 Instance Cluster at number 41 uses Amazon EC2. The latest supercomputer rankings revealed a marked increase in the use of AMD processors. Perlmutter, for instance, uses AMD Epyc 7763 processors. At number 6 on the list, Selene also has an AMD processor using the AMD Epyc 7742. Another point of interest is that this list saw fewer systems in China than expected. Chinese machines accounted for 186 supercomputers on the TOP500 list. The previous edition of the list saw 212 machines out of China, which is a significant drop. There also wasn’t much change in the variety of system interconnects. Ethernet is still used in around half of the systems, Infiniband was around a third of the machines, OmniPath interconnects made up less than one-tenth, and only one system relied on Myrinet. Custom interconnects accounted for 37 systems, while proprietary networks were found on six systems. Below is a summary of the top 10 supercomputers in the world. Fugaku has 7,630,848 cores which allowed it to achieve an HPL benchmark score of 442 Pflop/s. This puts it 3x ahead of the No. 2 system in the list. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-405077 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fugaku-640x426.jpg" alt="Fugaku" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fugaku-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fugaku-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fugaku-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fugaku.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Summit is an IBM-built system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee, USA.
