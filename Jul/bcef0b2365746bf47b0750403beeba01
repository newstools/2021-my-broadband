MyBroadband Insights has released the Q2 2021 Mobile Network Quality Report, which shows that MTN has the best mobile network in South Africa. The report is based on 304,001 speed tests which were performed by thousands of MyBroadband Speed Test App users across South Africa between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021. The research shows that South Africa had an average mobile download speed of 37.49Mbps and an average upload speed of 13.59Mbps. MTN had the highest average download speed at 67.22Mbps, followed by Vodacom on 33.74Mbps, Telkom on 29.04Mbps, Cell C on 20.72Mbps and Rain on 11.83Mbps. MTN’s exceptional performance results from outspending its rivals on infrastructure investment over the past five years. MTN’s R50 billion network investment helped it extend coverage, improve network quality, and increase speeds. It is noteworthy that the average download speed in South Africa is 10Mbps faster than what it was a year ago. The improved network performance results from increased network investment and temporary spectrum issued to mobile operators during the lockdown. This temporary spectrum helped mobile networks to increase their network capacity and improve their average speeds during the lockdown. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-406004 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Average-download-speed-640x346.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="346" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Average-download-speed-640x346.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Average-download-speed-600x325.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Average-download-speed-768x416.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Average-download-speed-1200x650.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Average-download-speed.jpg 1332w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Best mobile network in South Africa To determine the best mobile network in South Africa, a “Network Quality Score” was calculated for each network using download speed, upload speed, and latency.
