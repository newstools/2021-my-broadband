Netflix and Showmax have both added scores of new movies and TV shows to their libraries over the last few days, which means there really is something for everyone to watch this weekend. A survey recently conducted by comparison firm Finder found that around 56% of South Africans subscribed to at least one video streaming service. Of those that participated in the survey, more than half said they paid for a Netflix subscription. With the official launch of Netflix’s cheaper mobile plan in South Africa earlier this week, the international streaming giant will now also compete in the entry-level market, where Showmax has been offering a mobile-only option for some time. While MultiChoice’s service did not fair as well as Netflix in Finder’s survey, it very likely boasts many thousands of users thanks to its free inclusion on the DStv Premium package. In its most recent financial results, MultiChoice also claimed that its video-on-demand business, including Showmax, saw big growth. The new movies and TV shows available this week from these two streaming services cover various genres — including action, horror, thriller, comedy, and drama. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-281559" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Showmax-Netflix.jpg" alt="Showmax Netflix" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Showmax-Netflix.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Showmax-Netflix-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Showmax-Netflix-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Netflix alone added over 40 new titles to its South African library on Thursday, including big blockbusters like Dunkirk, Aquaman, Tarzan, and the original Mission Impossible trilogy. For classic slasher horror movie fans or those who enjoyed IT and Stranger Things, the first of three movies in the three-week Fear Street Film Trilogy event will be the most enticing addition. Based on the books of the same name by renowned Goosebumps writer R.L. Stine, Fear Street tells the story of a group of teenagers who have to take on malignant — and sometimes paranormal — enemies in the fictional town of Shadyside. Headlining Showmax’s new offerings this week is what many film critics consider to be one of the best movies from the last decade — Parasite. The South Korean thriller became the first non-English movie to win the Best Picture Academy Award in 2020. Parasite tells the story of the struggling Kim family who cunningly work their way into the servitude of the wealthy Parks household.
