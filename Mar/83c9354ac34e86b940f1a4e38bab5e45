Microsoft has announced that it will expand its Surface device range in South Africa with the launch of the Surface Book 3. The device is available for consumers in retail from Incredible Connection stores, the company said. The Surface Book 3 is a convertible that comprises a powerful tablet with a detachable keyboard. It combines speed, graphics, immersive gaming and long battery life with the versatility of a laptop, tablet, and portable studio. “We are excited to expand our Surface family with the addition of Surface Book 3 – our most powerful laptop yet,” said Microsoft South Africa Consumer and Channel Marketing Director Vithesh Reddy. “It is a portable powerhouse that provides the performance to tackle any task, from intensive video and graphic files to high-octane gaming. Developers, designers and professionals can rely on it for coding, compiling workloads, and for gaming.” The device is available in 13.5- or 15-inch sizes and is powered by a quad-core 10th Gen Intel® Core™ processor, as well as a discrete Nvidia graphics chip. GPU options include the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Max-Q for the 13.5-inch version and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q for the 15-inch model. “Whether compiling code for your latest app, sketching, editing video or getting immersed in the latest game, you’re able to set the perfect angle for you,” Reddy said. The 13.5-inch and 15-inch versions of the Surface Book 3 are available to purchase from Incredible Connection at the following prices: Both laptops offer Intel Core i7 1065G7 processors and Nvidia Max-Q graphics.
