OPPO recently launched its Reno5 5G smartphone in South Africa, which is the company’s first high-end smartphone to arrive in the local market. This smartphone, which is available from Technomobi, is one of the coolest launches of 2021 and offers powerful performance, great looks, and innovative technologies. Head of Go-to-Market and Operations at OPPO South Africa Liam Faurie said that the Reno5 5G is the company’s most ambitious smartphone ever. “It incorporates world-class updates into a usable device that upgrades the consumer’s daily digital efficiencies, while using humanable technology that improves everyday connections to each other, especially during these uncertain times,” said Faurie. The Reno5 5G offers everything you expect from a premium smartphone – minus the exorbitant price tag. Key features include 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G 5G processor, and a 6.44-inch Full HD 90Hz OLED display. It boasts a quad-lens rear camera system which includes a 64MP primary sensor as well as complementary ultra-wide, macro, and depth sensors. This is combined with a 32MP front camera, which allows you to take great selfies. Another cool feature of this smartphone’s camera systems is the ability to record dual-view video, meaning you can record on the front and rear cameras at the same time. This opens a whole new world of videography and is particularly useful for content creators who want to record their face while also recording happenings around them. The OPPO Reno5 5G offers the latest battery charging technology. The battery itself is impressive, with a 4,300mAh capacity that ensures you don’t have to worry about losing power halfway through the day. When you do need to charge it, however, OPPO’s 65W Super-Vooc flash charge technology is super fast. This technology allows for a full battery charge in just 36 minutes – speed which is unmatched in the smartphone market. For example: If you wake up in the morning and realise you forgot to charge your phone, you could plug it in, get ready for work, and by the time you leave it would be fully charged. Leading South African technology retailer Technomobi now has the OPPO Reno5 5G smartphone available on its online store. Pricing begins at R14,999, which is truly exceptional given the premium features and performance of this smartphone. Click here to buy the OPPO Reno5 5G from Technomobi.
