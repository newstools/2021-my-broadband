Dell Technologies is running a TechByte webinar on 17 March about the importance of having the tools to work from anywhere. This webinar will be hosted by Aki Anastasiou, who is known for hosting shows such as What’s Next on MyBroadband and TechHub on eNCA. Theoretical Physicist and Founder of Proudly Human Dr Adriana Marais will present on future technologies and how they will impact our future – both on Earth and beyond. Dell Technologies Director of Client Solutions Chris Buchanan will discuss South African Data Transformation Index findings, as well as general trends in the South African space. Additionally, Dell Technologies’ Jonathan Ryall and Intel will discuss the new Intel-powered Work from Anywhere devices Dell Technologies has launched so far this year. This webinar comes as companies around the world change the way they work, a trend which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees needed to work from home to stop the spread of the virus, and soon discovered that remote working and hybrid working solutions are not only feasible, but often preferable. This was evident in the PC market, which surpassed sales predictions by nearly 20% last year. IDC research found that Dell Technologies was the most popular commercial PC manufacturer in South Africa over this period, meaning the company is expertly positioned to help organisations equip their teams with the right hardware. This is not limited to PCs, however, as Dell Technologies offers market-leading monitors and peripherals to optimise the experience of your remote and hybrid working teams.
