Axxess has partnered with Link Layer to expand its fibre reach in KwaZulu-Natal. The partnership will benefit North Coast residents in particular, as this is where Link Layer’s network is situated. Link Layer uses the world’s best fibre technologies in its impressive network and is ideally placed to serve the North Coast community – as it has an intricate understanding of the region. The Link Layer network currently covers North Beach, Westbrook, Ballito, Umhlali, Sheffield Beach, and Salt Rock. Additionally, Link Layer’s first build has recently gone live – in Sunrise Beach – and the fibre network operator has an exciting and busy build plan for the rest of 2021.
