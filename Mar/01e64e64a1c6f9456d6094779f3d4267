Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass for PC subscription will be getting EA Play games from Thursday. The company first announced back in September 2020 that the roster of titles available on the EA Play subscription would be added to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Game Pass for PC subscriptions. While the former got its EA Play treatment for Xbox console owners back in December, the PC iteration of Xbox Game Pass was delayed. According to Xbox, this was done to ensure the Xbox App delivered a better experience for EA Play. Starting from 14:00 Pacific Time (23:00 South African time) on Thursday, Xbox Game Pass for PC subscribers will be able to play 60 of EA’s titles. This includes numerous games from the Battlefield, Star Wars, FIFA, Titanfall, Need for Speed, Command & Conquer and Sims franchises. In addition, subscribers will get access to the following: Xbox Game Pass for PC is priced at R99 per month in South Africa, while the Ultimate option for both console and PC will set you back R149 per month. The addition of EA Play on Xbox Game Pass for PC will push the number of titles available to more than 300, as the Xbox website currently lists 253 games without EA’s titles. Once the games are added, Xbox Game Pass for PC users will have to download the EA Desktop app and log into or create their EA Account. They will then have to link their Xbox account and EA account to be able to install and play the games from within the Xbox app. There are several ways to do the above, as outlined in the steps in the images below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-389942 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep3-640x360.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep3-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep3-600x338.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep3-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep3-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep3-1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep3.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-389944 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep6-640x360.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep6-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep6-600x338.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep6-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep6-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep6-1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep6.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-389946 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep7-640x360.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep7-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep7-600x338.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep7-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep7-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep7-1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/XGPCommunityStep7.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
