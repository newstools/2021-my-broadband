Everyshop is the latest ecommerce player in South Africa, offering a wide range of products from leading brands. It forms part of the JD Group, coupling it with high-profile retail chains like Russells, Bradlows, Hi-Fi Corp and Incredible Connection. Linked to these stores, Everyshop offers products across several industries including electronics, appliances, furniture and household goods. Its launch comes at a time where Takealot dominates the South African e-commerce market. As a result of this control, the Competition Commission recently announced that they will actively investigate Takealot and implement any necessary measures to prevent the abuse of dominance. Through the Online Intermediation Platforms Market Inquiry (OIPMI), the Commission intends to remedy the imbalance and provide equal opportunity for competitors. In the course of its recent launch, Everyshop is running a promotion with price cuts on tech and other products.
