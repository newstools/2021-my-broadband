MTN recently published its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2020, showing steady subscriber growth in South Africa. The mobile network remains a top-two operator and is well ahead of Telkom and Cell C. It falls behind Vodacom in the number of total subscribers, but it has held the title of the best network in South Africa for the past three years – making it a competitive option considering its similar data and contract pricing. MTN saw service revenue grow by 1.9% in South Africa and 11.9% across the group over its last financial year. “We continued to perform favourably against our medium-term targets,” said MTN Group CEO Ralph Mupita. MTN also plans to invest approximately R29.1 billion in its network, fintech, and digital services platforms in 2021.
