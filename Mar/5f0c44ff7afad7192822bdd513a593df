A recent campaign run by South Africa’s premier mobile app development company – Codehesion – illustrates the power of content marketing on MyBroadband. Appearing on the front page of MyBroadband provided Codehesion with the highest response of all its marketing campaigns. Using a combination of sponsored content on MyBroadband’s home page and social media promotions through MyBroadband’s channels, the results were excellent.
