There are numerous capable budget smartphones available in South Africa for less than R3,000. The expansion of mobile broadband has helped bring online connectivity to people living in rural areas and small towns in South Africa. Recently, Vodacom announced it completed the rollout of 84 base stations in remote locations across KwaZulu-Natal, bringing cellular connectivity to certain communities for the first time. Many cannot afford the prices paid by more affluent long-time smartphone users, who in some cases cough up R20,000 or more for the latest flagship models. However, leading smartphone manufacturers now offer a wide selection of mid-range and budget smartphones to cater to people who need a more affordable device. We assembled a list of smartphones from well-known manufacturers available in South Africa that offered a balance of solid specifications and affordability, with price tags between R1,500 and R3,000. South Korean giant Samsung, which dominates smartphone sales in the country thanks to its Galaxy A series, boasted two strong entries in the form of the Galaxy A12 and Galaxy A21s, its two best-selling smartphones globally in the first quarter of 2021. The Galaxy A21s has a particularly formidable arsenal of specifications at its disposal in this price range including Samsung’s own Exynos 850 processor, a quad rear camera with a 48MP main sensor, and a large 5,000mAh battery supporting 15W fast charging. However, Samsung’s prominence is being challenged by a handful of up-and-coming Chinese makers that are making big inroads globally — Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo offer powerful smartphones for under R3,000 in South Africa. Perhaps most notable among these is the Xiaomi Rednote 9, which offers the same quad-camera configuration as the Galaxy A21s, but with double the internal storage. It is also the only smartphone at this price with a 1080p display, while all the others we found only offered 720p resolutions. Huawei, however, does not have any strong contenders in this price range at the moment. Its popular P Smart S and P Smart 2021 handsets are priced between R4,000 and R5,000, and its best entry among our cheaper smartphones was 2019’s Huawei Y6s. Local manufacturer Mara has also attempted to capture the budget market, with various models models at different affordable price-points. Its Mara X1 costs R2,799 and offers similar components as the other smartphones we found. Mara’s primary advantage is that it ships the near-stock Google’s near-stock Android One operating system, as opposed to the third-party skins used by other OEMs to customise the experience on their handsets. This means it comes with no bloatware, saving valuable storage space and minimising any impacts on performance unwanted apps my cause. Below are 13 of the best budget smartphones you can buy in South Africa right now. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-400579"
