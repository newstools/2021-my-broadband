Hisense Laser TVs are the perfect choice for watching the Euro 2020 football tournament. Their sheer size, combined with amazing audio, brings the stadium to your living room – and you will truly feel like you are sitting in the stands and cheering on your favourite players. The ground-breaking laser display technology takes the viewing experience to another level entirely, meaning you will be able to see an amazing amount of detail on the pitch in incredibly accurate colours. Whether Cristiano Ronaldo is slotting home a penalty or Kylian Mbappe is breezing past a defender – you will catch all of the action in amazing quality. The design of these TVs also causes much less strain on your eyes because the lighting technology is reflected off the TV before reaching your eyes – whereas most TVs use active illumination and the light is being transmitted directly to your eyes. This means you can spend several hours each day watching historic rivalries like France vs Germany and England vs Scotland in comfort.
