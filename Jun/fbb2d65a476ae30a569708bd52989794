Samsung has added three new monitor models to its Odyssey line-up for gamers. The company said these new displays offer hyper-real picture quality, a higher response level, tailored ergonomics, and intuitive usability. “Together with these latest features, gaming enthusiasts can enjoy real-world colours, pinpoint accuracy and sharp response speeds for their PC and console gaming entertainment devices,” the company said. Unlike the current high-end G7 and top-of-the-range G9 monitors, these new entries sport a flat design and IPS panels instead of QLED displays, which should make them more affordable. Topping the new range is the 28-inch Odyssey G7, which seems to be geared towards those gamers with powerful systems that have no problems rendering high resolutions at more than 60 frames per second. The 28-inch Odyssey G7 supports an Ultra High Definition (UHD) of 3,840 x 2,160, 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and HDR400. To eliminate screen tearing issues it also boasts Nvidia G-Sync compatibility and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. HDMI 2.1 compatibility makes it suitable for the next-generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles, which are capable of running in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. For added immersion, the new G7 sports a light on its back panel that reproduces the colours of in-game imagery. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-402681 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Odyssey-G7.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Odyssey-G7.jpeg 1000w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Odyssey-G7-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Odyssey-G7-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Odyssey-G7-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> 1440p gamers will favour the revamped Odyssey G5 27-inch flat-screen model. It boasts a Quad High Definition (QHD) panel with a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and HDR10 support. Nvidia G-Sync compatibility and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro are also supported. For gamers on a tighter budget, the Odyssey G3 is the most affordable model of the new monitors. Available in either 24-inch or 27-inch sizes, it boasts full HD resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and support for AMD FreeSync Premium. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-402691" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-14.05.07.png" alt="Odyssey G3" width="1024" height="829" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-14.05.07.png 1432w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-14.05.07-494x400.png 494w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-14.05.07-531x430.png 531w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-14.05.07-768x622.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-14.05.07-1200x972.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The Odyssey G3 27-inch is available now from Takealot at R5,199, a price point at which it will compete with established budget contenders from AOC, ASUS, Dell, and LG.
