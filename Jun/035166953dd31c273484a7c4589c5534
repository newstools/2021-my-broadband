This natural wood horn speaker amplifies your smartphone’s sound by channelling it through a patented acoustic chamber. Not only does this increase volume, but the company claims it provides higher clarity and better dynamic range with fuller, warmer, and richer tones than your smartphone’s speaker. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-399739" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Symphonica-acoustic-speaker-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Symphonica-acoustic-speaker-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Symphonica-acoustic-speaker-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Symphonica-acoustic-speaker-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Symphonica-acoustic-speaker.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The dropping of 3.5mm headphone jacks from flagship smartphones may come as an annoyance to many who must now buy converter cables to use older headphones. Helm Bolt, however, saw an opportunity to turn them into something useful, by adding a high-end Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC) which can improve the audio quality output of your smartphone. This is the perfect solution for audiophiles who use high-fidelity headphones and streaming services but find that their phone’s built-in conversion is just not up to scratch. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-399709" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/helm-audio-audio-accessory-helm-bolt-dac-amp-mqa-certified-pre-order-today-840020800071-wireless-headphones-wireless-earbuds-audiophile-15314534465672_1200x-e1622555241650.png" alt="" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/helm-audio-audio-accessory-helm-bolt-dac-amp-mqa-certified-pre-order-today-840020800071-wireless-headphones-wireless-earbuds-audiophile-15314534465672_1200x-e1622555241650.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/helm-audio-audio-accessory-helm-bolt-dac-amp-mqa-certified-pre-order-today-840020800071-wireless-headphones-wireless-earbuds-audiophile-15314534465672_1200x-e1622555241650-593x400.png 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/helm-audio-audio-accessory-helm-bolt-dac-amp-mqa-certified-pre-order-today-840020800071-wireless-headphones-wireless-earbuds-audiophile-15314534465672_1200x-e1622555241650-637x430.png 637w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/helm-audio-audio-accessory-helm-bolt-dac-amp-mqa-certified-pre-order-today-840020800071-wireless-headphones-wireless-earbuds-audiophile-15314534465672_1200x-e1622555241650-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/helm-audio-audio-accessory-helm-bolt-dac-amp-mqa-certified-pre-order-today-840020800071-wireless-headphones-wireless-earbuds-audiophile-15314534465672_1200x-e1622555241650-768x518.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This handy smart sports ring comes with a joystick which allows you to control various functions on your smartphone or other connected Bluetooth devices from your finger. It lets you navigate the interface, answer calls, and control music playback, making it suitable for uninterrupted exercise sessions or even to interact with your phone while driving, so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road or your hands off the steering wheel. The ArcSports Ring is small, but the company claims that its battery lasts for up to five days with just one hour of charging. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-399715 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ArcX-sports-ring.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ArcX-sports-ring.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ArcX-sports-ring-600x338.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Xenvo Pro Lens kit brings your smartphone camera a little closer to a professional DSLR camera. A wide lens extends your smartphone camera’s field of view by 45%, while the macro lens lets you magnify shots to take clear close-up photos. The kit includes these two lenses and an attachment bracket, together with a small attachable LED light to illuminate subjects. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-399737" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Xenvo-Lens-Kit-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Xenvo-Lens-Kit-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Xenvo-Lens-Kit-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Xenvo-Lens-Kit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Xenvo-Lens-Kit.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Macro lenses on smartphones are getting better at capturing great close-up shots, but they don’t reveal microscopic details yet. Biologists and the inquisitive who want to explore the finer details of the world might find great value in a pocket microscope which can be fitted to your smartphone camera. The Carson MicroFlip Pocket Microscope allows for between 100 and 250 times magnification, and comes with a built-in LED flashlight and UV light, powered by a single AA battery. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-399751" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carson-microscope-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carson-microscope-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carson-microscope-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carson-microscope-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carson-microscope.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Although smartphone camera night modes have seen great improvements over the last few years, the truth is that nothing works as well as proper lighting to get perfect shots in dark environments. The Bigsofti is a powerful but compact soft LED light with a clamp for easily attaching to your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. It offers five brightness and three colour settings to adjust lighting to your preference. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-399759 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.45.10-e1622560443598-640x414.png" alt="" width="640" height="414" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.45.10-e1622560443598-640x414.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.45.10-e1622560443598-600x389.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.45.10-e1622560443598-768x497.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.45.10-e1622560443598-1536x995.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.45.10-e1622560443598-1200x777.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.45.10-e1622560443598.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Mobile gaming has become big business, and any serious mobile gamer will know it’s not optimal to be using touch controls while obscuring your display with your thumbs. The Razer Kishi gamepad for Android and iOS snaps onto the back and sides of your smartphone and is powered and connected by a USB-C or Lightning connector. The gamepad includes two thumbsticks, a D-pad, triggers, and the typical actions buttons you would find on a gaming console controller. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-399719" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Razer-Kishi-new-e1622555984357.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="452" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Razer-Kishi-new-e1622555984357.jpg 1125w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Razer-Kishi-new-e1622555984357-567x400.jpg 567w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Razer-Kishi-new-e1622555984357-609x430.jpg 609w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Razer-Kishi-new-e1622555984357-768x542.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The DropLabs EP 01 haptic sneakers are designed to provide a “full body sound experience” with 360-degree vibrations around the foot of the wearer that are synced via Bluetooth to the audio you are listening to on your smartphone or computer. The company says these shoes transform listening to music, movies, and games into an immersive, live experience. There is also a low-latency gaming package that includes cables to directly connect to your PC for the shortest possible delay between in-game audio and the haptic feedback on the shoes. The shoes offers 6 hours of battery life and are charged using a magnetic charger which is connected to their backs. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-399723" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DropLabs-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DropLabs-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DropLabs-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DropLabs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DropLabs.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
