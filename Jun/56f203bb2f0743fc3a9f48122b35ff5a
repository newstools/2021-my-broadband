HP has unveiled its new Pavilion Aero 13 laptop, an ultra-lightweight machine weighing less than a kilogram. The 13-inch laptop will be the company’s lightest consumer device ever produced and will feature a full magnesium-aluminium chassis. Its 13.3-inch display will have a 2560 x 1600, or 2.5K resolution, and have a 90% screen-to-body ratio. The Aero 13’s display will also have 400-nits of peak brightness. For reference, this is the same display brightness as Apple’s M1 Macbook Air. Under the hood, the laptop will feature AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800U mobile processor, which has 8 cores and 16 threads, as well as a maximum clock frequency of 4.4GHz. The Ryzen 7 5800U processor also has integrated Radeon graphics. According to HP, the laptop will have a battery life of up to 10.5 hours. There will be four Aero 13 colours to choose from, which HP states as: Pale Rose Gold, Warm Gold, Ceramic White, and Natural Silver. The Aero 13 will be available from July, and the US starting price will be $749, or R10,700, though South Africans can expect it to be more expensive once it starts to sell in the country. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-404133" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HP-Monitor-release-604x430.jpg" alt="HP Monitor release" width="640" height="456" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HP-Monitor-release-604x430.jpg 604w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HP-Monitor-release-562x400.jpg 562w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HP-Monitor-release.jpg 716w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> With the Aero 13, HP also announced two new monitors, one 24-inch and the other 27-inch.
