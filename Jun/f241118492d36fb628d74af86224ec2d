Apple’s iPhones dominate the rankings of the most sold smartphones of all time, but until the 2014 release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, it was the Nokia 5230 that held the record as the best-selling smartphone of all time. It could be argued that the Nokia 5230, released in 2009, still holds its title if you count the sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus separately. Unfortunately, there are no separate sales estimates available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, making it difficult to prove one way or the other. When Apple released the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus it significantly increased the screen size of its smartphones, owing to pressure from rivals like Samsung that were gaining market share with their larger displays. The move paid off handsomely and Apple sold 222 million of these smartphones to date. Another runaway success for Apple was the iPhone 11. It released in 2019 and is estimated to have sold over 100 million units to date, placing it at number three on these charts. Other Apple smartphones in the top ten include the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 5. Completing the top 10 are the formidable Samsung Galaxy S4, released in 2013, and the Samsung Galaxy S3 and S3 Mini. Together these three Samsung devices have sold around 150 million units to date. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-357463" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Apple-iPhones-640x430.jpg" alt="Apple iPhones" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Apple-iPhones.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Apple-iPhones-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Apple-iPhones-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While Android-based smartphones from Samsung and Huawei are more common in South Africa, Apple is very popular in some of the biggest smartphone markets in the world — including its home ground of the United States. According to Newzoo’s Global Mobile Market Report, the US has one of the highest penetration rates for smartphone users at over 80%. With a market share of around 55% in a country with a population of more than 300 million people, it’s easy to see why Apple’s iPhones account for seven of the top ten touchscreen-based smartphones sold in the world. Below are images, specifications, pricing, and the latest reported sales numbers of the top 10 best-selling smartphones of all time. The list does not include any feature phones, bar phones, or flip phones. In rows where more than one specification is noted, the top refers to the higher-end model and the bottom to the lower-end variant. This ranking is derived from statistics collected on the Wikipedia page for the list of best-selling mobile phones, which cites sales estimates from various sources all over the web. <img
