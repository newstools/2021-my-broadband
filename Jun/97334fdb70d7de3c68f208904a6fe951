Action-packed blockbusters, family dramas, and crime thrillers are all on the menu for Netflix and Showmax subscribers this weekend. Arguably the biggest addition this week is Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049, which is now streaming on Netflix in South Africa. The highly anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott’s 80’s cult hit won five Academy Awards in 2018, with its visual effects and sound design being particularly breathtaking. In South Africa, Netflix has become such a streaming powerhouse, that even leading pay-TV broadcaster MultiChoice has stopped trying to fight it. Instead, it now has plans to become a one-stop entertainment shop for South Africans and offers the very same streaming service that it blamed for a drop in DStv Premium subscribers through its Explora Ultra decoder. This does not mean that MultiChoice has given up on its own streaming service, Showmax. In the company’s most recent financial results presentation, MultiChoice claimed that Showmax saw big growth over the last year. Showmax has one big advantage over Netflix — its library of high-quality local productions which appeal to many South Africans. This now includes South African family drama 3 Days to Go, which was added this week. New international titles on the service include musical drama The High Note, and the insightful Joy Of documentary collection. Below are 10 of the latest additions to Netflix and Showmax to watch this weekend.
