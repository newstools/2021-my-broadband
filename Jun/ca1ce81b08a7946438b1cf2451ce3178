Aurik Enterprise Development is giving South African SMEs the opportunity to join its Enterprise and Supplier Development programme. Aurik has worked with over 2,800 SMEs across three continents and 32 industries, delivering  compound annual growth rates for the SMEs it works with, of 28.9% over the past five years, with 4% average net EBITDA growth. This opportunity, which is being sponsored by a global technology market leader, is focused specifically on black-owned businesses and will incorporate successful applicants into its Independent Software Vendor (ISV) programme. Successful applicants will also receive loan investment opportunities, which will help them get the liquidity to expand their operations.
