The first-ever Leica-branded smartphone – the Leitz Phone 1 – will be launched in July. The German camera company is renowned for making high-quality photographic equipment used by professionals and enthusiasts alike. It has partnered with a number of smartphone manufacturers to bring its photographic expertise to mobile devices, with the most notable being Huawei’s flagship P-series and Mate series, which have received high praise for their camera systems. At its core, the Leitz 1 is actually a rebranded Sharp Aquos R6, with the only differences being its design and circular camera bump. The rear camera is a single 1-inch 20MP sensor with f/1.9 aperture. At that size, it is the largest on any smartphone. Leica includes a magnetic lens cap in the phone’s box to protect it from bumps and scratches. On the front, users get a 12.6MP selfie camera. On the display and performance side, the Leitz 1 boasts all the bells and whistles of a proper flagship smartphone. The 6.6-inch OLED display boasts a 2,730 x 1,260 resolution, with an effective 120Hz refresh rate. The smartphone is powered by a Snapdragon 888 SoC paired with 12GB RAM, boasts 256GB of internal storage, and packs a 5,000mAh battery. 5G cellular connectivity and Wi-Fi 6 are also supported. For now, the Leitz 1 is exclusive to Softbank, a telecoms service provider in Japan. It will be selling for 87,920 yen (R11,180), with the lens cap and Leica-branded hard case included. Below are the specifications and images of the Leica Leitz Phone 1. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-402215" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-Leitz-1-e1623920106623.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="531" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-Leitz-1-e1623920106623.jpeg 843w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-Leitz-1-e1623920106623-482x400.jpeg 482w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-Leitz-1-e1623920106623-519x430.jpeg 519w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-Leitz-1-e1623920106623-768x637.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-402217" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-lens-and-hard-cover.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-lens-and-hard-cover.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-lens-and-hard-cover-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-lens-and-hard-cover-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leica-lens-and-hard-cover-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
