If you are looking to give your IT or telecoms company excellent exposure and make it stand out, then MyBroadband is the place to be. MyBroadband is South Africa’s largest IT publication, with 2 million monthly readers, and is home to the largest ICT community in the country. For many IT executives and decision markets, MyBroadband is the first website they visit each day – and the last site they read before going to bed. To get onto the front page of MyBroadband is therefore the most effective way to position your company as a leader in the ICT field – as you reach the largest congregation of IT decision makers in South Africa. This is, however, only a part of what MyBroadband offers South African IT and telecommunications companies. Its new online conferences, like the upcoming 2021 Cloud Conference, provide another easy way for a company to deliver their message to a highly-targeted audience.
