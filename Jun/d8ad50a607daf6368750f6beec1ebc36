Many businesses have been devastated by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent national lockdowns. Companies that were already facing disruptions in their industry, and those that rely on human labour, leisure travel, and other human interaction have been badly hit. These organisations have had to face difficult choices such as salary freezes or pay cuts, retrenchments, business rescue, or declaring bankruptcy. The impact on businesses was reflected in official employment statistics from Stats SA, which reported this week that South Africaâ€™s unemployment rate has risen to a new all-time high. According to Stats SA, the official unemployment figure for South Africa is now 32.6%, up from 32.5% in the past three months. Over 7.2 million people are unemployed in South Africa. Not all businesses suffered because of the pandemic, though. Many IT and telecoms companies were beneficiaries with people working from home and the changing environment. Vodacom, MTN, Google, and Apple, and many others reported standout results. Investors piled into tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook which have with strong balance sheets and good growth opportunities. Most of their growth, however, was realised in 2020 when the stock market recovery took place. This raises the question what the growth of prominent tech companies looked like this year. To answer this question, we looked the change in share price between January and May 2021. The following table shows how a selection of South African technology stocks performed since the start of 2021. The following table shows how the share prices of big US technology firms performed since 1 January 2021. GameStop is included as an interesting anomaly. The company saw its share price propelled upward by retail investors earlier this year.
