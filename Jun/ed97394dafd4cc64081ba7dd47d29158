The latest stint of load-shedding has interrupted the lives of millions of South Africans, and there is unfortunately no end in sight. Whether you are working from home and need power, or are keeping your family entertained after-hours, having an alternative power source is crucial to get you through the rolling blackouts. Takealot understands that many South African households currently don’t have sufficient measures in place to deal with Eskom load-shedding – and that these households think solutions are too expensive for them to afford. This is why Takealot has focused on providing products that equip South African households to survive load-shedding regardless of their budget, ensuring that no one is left out from the benefits of alternative power solutions. South Africa’s leading online retailer has curated many of its load-shedding products into price-based groups, where you can search for energy products that fit your budget. The three groups include products below R3,000, below R5,000, and below R10,000 – and include UPSs, inverters, and rechargeable lights. We have detailed great products that are available in each of these sections below. The products available for under R3,000 features a number of UPS devices that offer amazing value for money. They will be able to power a number of lights and appliances without breaking the bank. You can also get other great load-shedding products such as powerful rechargeable lights. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-403231" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCT-850VA-UPS.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="429" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCT-850VA-UPS.jpg 601w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCT-850VA-UPS-597x400.jpg 597w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RCT-850VA-UPS-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-403233 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mecer-2000VA-UPS-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mecer-2000VA-UPS-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mecer-2000VA-UPS-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mecer-2000VA-UPS-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mecer-2000VA-UPS-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mecer-2000VA-UPS-1200x807.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mecer-2000VA-UPS.jpg 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-403235 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Magneto-Rechargeable-Compact-Floodlight-640x341.png" alt="" width="640" height="341" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Magneto-Rechargeable-Compact-Floodlight-640x341.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Magneto-Rechargeable-Compact-Floodlight-600x319.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Magneto-Rechargeable-Compact-Floodlight-768x409.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Magneto-Rechargeable-Compact-Floodlight-1200x639.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Magneto-Rechargeable-Compact-Floodlight.png 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The UPS products under R5,000 offer even more power than those in the previous category, and are great for those looking for the optimal balance between price and performance.
