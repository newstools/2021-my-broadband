Sentech and Radio Network Solutions have in principle agreed to collaborate to bring SuperCell high-capacity broadband solutions to South Africa. Sentech is a state-owned communications infrastructure company that has historically focused on broadcasting signal distribution, and Radio Network Solutions (RNS) is an RF coverage specialist company based in Johannesburg. RNS, as the regional distributor for Matsing LENS antennas, will supply the RF design, product and installation services to Sentech. Sentech and RNS seek to use this technology to deliver broadband to all areas of South Africa – especially underserved areas affected by the digital divide. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-401609" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SuperCell-Radio-Networks.png" alt="" width="640" height="419" /> SuperCell coverage vs. conventional 1G/2G, 3G/4G coverage. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-401611" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-picture-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="622" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-picture-1.jpg 1098w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-picture-1-412x400.jpg 412w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-picture-1-442x430.jpg 442w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-picture-1-768x746.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> A drone view of SuperCell base station installed at 180m of broadcast tower SuperCell capabilities are defined by two key technical features: According to GSMA’s most recent data, there are still 600 million people globally living outside of areas covered by mobile broadband networks, and the majority of these people live in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the contributing factors to this problem are low population density and very low average revenue per user (ARPU) due to low population density – especially in rural areas. Therefore, to address these contributing factors, solutions must be able to meet the two key technical features of SuperCell, which are wide coverage and high-order sectorisation. Testing of the SuperCell technology found the following: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-401613" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="493" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-2.png 601w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-2-519x400.png 519w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-2-558x430.png 558w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Pathloss vs. tower height <img class="aligncenter wp-image-401615" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="345" /> Azimuth spread vs. tower height The testing was conducted using LTE band 41 (2500MHz, 20 MHz channel) a downlink throughput of 6 Mbps (50th percentile) and 7.8 Mbps (90th percentile), and an uplink throughput of 1 Mbps (50th percentile) and 1.2 Mbps (90th percentile) with a Samsung S7 at a range of 40 kilometres. Inter-sector handover also worked seamlessly during testing. The antenna system used to achieve high-order sectorisation and high gain was a Luneburg Lens antenna. Combination of high broadcast towers and Luneburg Lens antennas produce LTE broadband capacity better or equal to broadband enjoyed in urban areas. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-401617 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-4-640x213.png" alt="" width="640" height="213" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-4-640x213.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-4-600x200.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-4-768x255.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-4-1200x399.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Radio-Networks-Picture-4.png 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> SuperCell(SC) coverage / Macro-cell(MC) coverage / LTE signal levels comparison between SC vs. MC Due to wide coverage using broadcasting high towers, we predict that there will be a strong universal coverage achievement using this technology. This makes it suitable for rural areas. South Africa as a country has some security weakness which can be listed as follows: Nokia and other technology leaders have been experimenting using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drones to solve all the above security weaknesses. However, critical for successful UAV services is rock-solid network connectivity from superior connectivity offered by 4G or 5G networks. SuperCell solution will provide very cheap, high capacity, quick to deploy, rock solid 4G network everywhere in the country so that UAV can be controlled and managed everywhere they go. South Africa, in line with other countries internationally, identified IMT450 band for PPDR services. However, this band in SA is heavily used by certain state-owned entities, which will need to be migrated before this band becomes available. Although channel size that can be made available is only 5 MHz, key interest in this band is potential area of coverage which is estimated to be between 8 and 12 km in radius. SuperCell, already is achieving more that double the maximum expected coverage range of IMT450 band in frequency bands as high as 2.5 GHz and it is where there is plenty of available spectrum. It makes sense to include the PPDR services into the SuperCell solution for better cell range and capacity. Collaboration between Sentech and RNS is based on Sentech being the owner of the required high towers and RNS being the sole agent for Luneburg Lens antennas in Africa from OEM, Matsing. RNS has deployed these antennas to a number of customers already and these deployments are for high-capacity requirements only. Because South Africa is already covered by broadcast services from Sentech high towers, using the same infrastructure for high-capacity broadband will result in the fastest broadband deployment this country has ever seen. It is estimated that such a network can take 6 months to a year to deploy because all requirements to establish a cell site are already in place, and site acquisition, access roads, tower and power are already taken care of. Ultimately, Schools and healthcare facilities in rural areas will have equal connectivity with their counterparts in modern urban areas. Key advantage of SuperCell solution is that, accessing this high capacity only needs a normal smart phone whereas other means usually need proprietary user end equipment with cumbersome large antennas. Security services using the state of art technologies can be realized very quick to secure our infrastructure, game, borders, etc. PPDR services can as well be accommodated as plenty of capacity and required range is achieved. Planning and design of the deployment is prepared as a basic for two operators sharing, but it is possible to accommodate up to four operators. Given that the Supercell concept can give national coverage with substantial capex savings for a single operator, the savings are further increased by the addition of sharing parties. The need for access to spectrum for these broadband services cannot be overemphasised. This spectrum must be allocated in part for use in deploying public sector services in education, health and security. For further information, please contact:
