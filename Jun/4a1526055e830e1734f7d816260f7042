Dell Technologies is hosting a TechByte event on 24 June where the focus will be on edge computing. As digital transformation continues to affect every industry, it is important to understand how key technologies like edge computing can turbocharge your business.

Dell Technologies is an expert in edge computing and is therefore running their next TechByte webinar on the topic to help local businesses learn more. The event will be hosted by Aki Anastasiou – known for his hosting of What’s Next on MyBroadband and TecHub on eNCA. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Anastasiou will be joined on 24 June by a variety of top Dell Technologies professionals, including South African Managing Director Doug Woolley – who will be discussing “Flex on Demand.” The guest speaker at the event will be Mushambi Mutuma, who is a tech leader, serial entrepreneur, and speaker with over 12 years of experience in building brands and businesses in Africa. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-399999" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1-638x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1-638x430.jpg 638w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1-594x400.jpg 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1-768x517.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1-1200x808.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1.jpg 1375w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Mushambi Mutuma Additionally, Intel will be participating in a roundtable discussion alongside several Dell Technologies experts regarding complexity and value generation in the context of edge solutions.
