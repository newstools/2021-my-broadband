Edge computing is a key technology for the modern business. It helps organisations take advantage of new data sources and drives differentiated business outcomes across a broad range of industries. Many organisations are yet to take full advantage of this important technology, however, which is why Dell Technologies has dedicated its next TechByte event to this fascinating topic. The online event will take place on 24 June and will include valuable commentary from several top Dell Technologies experts who boast unique insight into edge computing. The guest speaker at the event is Mushambi Mutuma – a tech leader, serial entrepreneur, and speaker with over 12 years of business-building experience across Africa. <img class="size-large wp-image-401581 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3-596x400.jpg 596w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3-768x515.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3-1200x805.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3.jpg 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Intel will also be participating in the event in the form of a roundtable discussion alongside several Dell Technologies experts.
