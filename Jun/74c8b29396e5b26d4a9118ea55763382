Ecommerce giant Amazon has announced its Prime Day Countdown deals, which includes big discounts on Xbox and Ubisoft games. In anticipation of its renowned annual sale on 21 and 22 June, early deals are now available under fashion, home, and beauty products, as well as toys, sporting goods, pet supplies, electronics, Amazon brands, and Amazon Devices. “Prime members don’t have to wait to shop Prime Day deals. Starting today, members can shop and save on hundreds of thousands of early-release deals including exclusive offers that drop every day leading up to Prime Day,” Amazon stated. The following special offers are available across these categories: In addition to these discounts, Amazon will be slashing prices on its Echo devices by up to 70% from 13 June. These include the following: Amazon’s gaming and entertainment bundle will also be more than $40 off. This package includes a Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa Voice Remote and Luna Controller, for $73.98. It should be noted that many of the products listed above cannot be shipped directly to South Africa without a forwarding service. However, the Xbox and Ubisoft games, which are discounted by up to 50%, are eligible for shipping to South Africa. Comparing their sale prices with local listings shows that shoppers can save big on some of the latest titles, even when taking the shipping fees and import taxes into account. For example, Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla for Xbox or PlayStation will cost you R656.68 as opposed to R1,299 on Takealot. Below are some of the best Amazon Prime Day Countdown Deals on games and software. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-400481"
