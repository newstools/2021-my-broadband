The top three most-watched TV shows in South Africa in May were all broadcast on SABC 1, the latest television audience measurements published by the Broadcast Research Council of South Africa (BRCSA) revealed. While online video streaming services have been growing in popularity, conventional terrestrial and satellite broadcasting still reign supreme in South Africa. The State of the Broadcasting Industry Report of 2019 showed South Africa had 14.4 million TV households, with an audience of 38.2 million people. Pay-TV provider MultiChoice’s latest financial results revealed that it alone had 8.9 million DStv subscribers who had been active between January and March 2021. The BRCSA uses marketing research firm Nielsen’s sample-based People Meter technology to measure the viewing habits of TV audiences. One version of Nielsen’s solution comprises a paperback-sized box which is hooked up to the TV sets of sample households. It is accompanied by a remote control with assigned personal viewing buttons for each member of the household. The People Meter can then capture and relay this information, which is updated by Nielsen on a daily basis. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-402921" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/People-Meter-Box.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/People-Meter-Box.jpeg 1252w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/People-Meter-Box-533x400.jpeg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/People-Meter-Box-573x430.jpeg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/People-Meter-Box-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/People-Meter-Box-1200x900.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The latest data showed that dramas and soapies remained the most popular types of shows in South Africa during the prime time hours between 17:30 and 22:00.
