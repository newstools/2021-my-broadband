Growthpoint Properties has announced the completion of a new R470-million “first-of-its-kind” specialised surgical hospital in Pretoria. The Cintocare Hospital in the Menlyn Maine precinct is the first 5-star rated green hospital in Africa, and the fifth in the world which offers a specialised surgical mix and clinical business model. The hospital is a clinical centre of excellence focused exclusively on head, neck, spinal and vascular surgery, with no emergency facilities. Construction on the hospital began in July 2018 and was completed as scheduled at the end of 2020. The 29,000m² hospital building comprises seven levels – three for parking, one for the plant room, and three clinical and consulting levels. It offers a 100-bed capacity which can be expanded to 160 beds. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-392423" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Street-view-of-the-Cintocare-Hospital-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Street-view-of-the-Cintocare-Hospital-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Street-view-of-the-Cintocare-Hospital-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Street-view-of-the-Cintocare-Hospital-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Street-view-of-the-Cintocare-Hospital-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Street-view-of-the-Cintocare-Hospital-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Street-view-of-the-Cintocare-Hospital-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-392383" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-1-640x427.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-1-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-1-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-1-1200x800.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-392385" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-2-640x427.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-2-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-2-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-2-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-2-1200x800.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-392387" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-3-640x427.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-3-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-3-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-3-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-3-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cintocare-3-1200x800.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The facility’s medical professionals have access to state-of-the-art equipment and technology.

sustainable design and management features. This has earned it a 5 Green Star Custom Healthcare design certification from the Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA). These features include an HVAC system which places infection control and indoor air quality at the fore, while also ensuring increased maintenance access to keep it functioning optimally. Other green building features include: Furthermore, the inclusion of as much natural daylight as possible was regarded as critical. The hospital’s glazed façade ensures that 92% of the bedded areas have access to daylight and external views. In addition, Cintocare is South Africa’s first hospital to generate its own oxygen on demand using an installed PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) plant. Growthpoint said healthcare facilities with green designs offered many benefits, including a 15% faster recovery rate, 22% reduction in need for pain medication, 11% reduction in secondary infections and an 8.5% reduction in hospital stays.
