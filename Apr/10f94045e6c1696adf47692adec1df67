The Broadcast Research Council of South Africa (BRCSA) has released its television audience measurements for March 2021 which showed that Uzalo and Generations: The Legacy remained the most-watched TV shows in South Africa. This data from the BRCSA includes viewer numbers for the most-watched TV shows and other programming on SABC 1, SABC 2, SABC 3, eTV, and DStv. The top 5 airings overall remained largely unchanged from the previous month, with the exception of an Afrikaans news bulletin on SABC 2 that slipped into the fifth spot. SABC 1 drama Uzalo once again claimed the number 1 spot, with around 8.15 million viewers in its most-watched episode for the month. This was higher than its previous peak of 8.05 million viewers in February. It was followed by an episode of Generations: The Legacy with about 6.46 million viewers, also broadcasted on SABC 1. Etv soap Scandal rounded out the top three, with over 5.22 million viewers in its most-watched episode, claiming the title of third most-watched title. While it did not come close to contending at the top, SABC 3 scored a large number of viewers for broadcasting the Afcon qualifying game played between South Africa and Ghana. The 1.56 million viewers who tuned in for the game were more than double the peak viewership the channel had during its top performing airing in March – a broadcast of the nature documentary Desert Megapride. In the Pay-TV space, DStv’s Mzansi Magic channel once again dominated, claiming the top 6 airings on the service. M-Net original TV series Gomora took the crown from telenovela The Queen, both of which are aired on Mzansi Magic. Notably, however, peak viewerships for both were down when compared to February. The table below shows the most-watched TV shows and programming in South Africa by peak viewers. Embedded below are the full lists of most-watched episodes and programmes on each channel or broadcaster. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-393553" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-1-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-1-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-1-most-watched-shows-March-2021-600x306.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-1-most-watched-shows-March-2021-768x392.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-1-most-watched-shows-March-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-393557" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-2-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-2-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-2-most-watched-shows-March-2021-600x306.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-2-most-watched-shows-March-2021-768x392.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-2-most-watched-shows-March-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-393559" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-3-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-3-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-3-most-watched-shows-March-2021-600x306.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-3-most-watched-shows-March-2021-768x392.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SABC-3-most-watched-shows-March-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-393555" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Etv-most-watched-shows-March-2021--640x326.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Etv-most-watched-shows-March-2021--640x326.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Etv-most-watched-shows-March-2021--600x306.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Etv-most-watched-shows-March-2021--768x392.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Etv-most-watched-shows-March-2021-.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-393561" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DStv-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DStv-most-watched-shows-March-2021-640x326.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DStv-most-watched-shows-March-2021-600x306.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DStv-most-watched-shows-March-2021-768x392.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DStv-most-watched-shows-March-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
