Almost exactly one year ago, the world as it was known changed inexorably. Businesses around the globe had to close their premises and millions of office workers quickly transitioned to remote work from their homes. And while, in general, IT managed this emergency shift successfully, their work is far from over, explains Garsen Naidoo, General Manager of Cisco Sub-Saharan Africa. “Now that that initial urgency had been dealt with, a focus on the long-term plan is required for continued business resilience, considering where people will be working, how they’ll access online resources, and how their workloads can be secured and supported,” he says. This requires a fundamental change in the view of home networks being secondary to corporate, office-based networks. The home network is now essentially the default network. As such, it must be afforded the right connectivity support, and this means identifying the specific needs of different workers and tackling issues before they become critical. “Each individual’s situations and circumstances must be looked at, such as how important it is that they’re online 100 percent of the time, and do they have access to reliable ISP connectivity, as well as how many and what type of devices they’re using.” Research has found that 80 percent of leaders surveyed plan to allow staff to work remotely at least part of the time post pandemic, with close to fifty percent stating that employees would be able to work from home full-time. Furthermore, a PwC study said that 78 percent of CEOs surveyed believe that remote collaboration is here to stay. So, it could be safe to say that, even as lockdowns are lifted, many people will probably continue to work from home in some capacity and their home installations deserve the same level of consideration and support as those in the workplace.
