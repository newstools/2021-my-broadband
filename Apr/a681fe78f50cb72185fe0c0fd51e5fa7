After many years of selling their antennas into the States via trusted partners, Poynting Antennas is proud to announce the opening of their new premises in the USA. Poynting Inc was registered at the end of 2020 and their offices, with warehouse space, will open in Mansfield, Texas in April 2021. With this expansion Poynting will be able to accelerate their growth and take on the huge demand for their broadband antennas in the region. Dr Andre Fourie, Poynting Group CEO, remembers how they wanted to expand into the USA when Poynting was a small company with only a handful of products and employees. “About 20 years ago we boldly ventured into the US with no experience of international sales or business. Although not hugely successful, we created relationships with brave US companies that was willing to do business with an unknown company from South Africa,” said Fourie. “Since then, our ideal has always been to establish ourselves in the US on a permanent basis. After our success in selling into Europe, we now know that having people and stock locally makes a huge difference with regards to sales in an area.” “We are very excited about this expansion – I know that Juan and the Poynting Inc team will make a huge success of this exciting venture,” said Fourie. Juan Potgieter, President Poynting Inc said: “In the past years we have rapidly grown the interest in Poynting Antennas in the US, and we have had great success in all our different antenna verticals. Projects like the Poynting MIMO-3 antenna that is now used as a standard on the iconic Airstream Trailers.” “We realise that, with the help of our partners and by having warehousing and offices in the States, we can increase these opportunities greatly.

My name is Alexia Lindquist and I joined Poynting, Inc. last December as operations manager. For the last decade I have worked in the antenna industry and have learned many aspects of business along the way including accounting, HR, and my favorite, operations.

I was born in Texas and moved around a bit before ultimately settling down in the lone star state. I am a dual citizen of Sweden and speak Swedish fluently. Traveling is a passion for me as is food and family. When I’m not working you can find me enjoying the outdoors with my husband and dog or inside watching the newest binge worthy TV show.
