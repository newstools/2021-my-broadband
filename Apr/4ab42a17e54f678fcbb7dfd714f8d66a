Following a beta testing period of around three months, Apple has released the much-anticipated iOS 14.5 to all iPhone users. The major change in this update is enhanced privacy transparency, which lets users choose which apps are able to track their activity across other companies’ apps and websites for ads or sharing with data brokers. Another major addition is the ability to unlock your iPhone X or later with an Apple Watch while using Face ID. This feature was largely the result of iPhone users complaining they were unable to unlock their smartphones while wearing a face mask. Siri has also received a number of useful new features, including a more diverse range of voice options as well as the ability to call emergency contacts through a voice request. In addition, the virtual assistant is now able to announce incoming calls, including who is calling, while the user is wearing AirPods or compatible Beats headphones. Users can also initiate a FaceTime call by asking Siri to FaceTime a list of contacts or a group name from Messages.
