Standard Bank customers are reporting problems with using online banking and the mobile banking app. Standard Bank’s Downdetector page showed a sharp surge in complaints from just before 9:00 AM on Friday, with the number of reports remaining high as of 11:00 AM. On its social media channels, the bank said that users may experience issues when logging into Internet banking and the banking app. “We are working to resolve this urgently. Please use cellphone banking as an alternative,” the bank said. “We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” According to Downdetector and Twitter, the vast majority of reported problems appeared to be experienced on online banking. “Is something wrong with the Online Banking? It keeps timing out,” a Twitter user said. Multiple users complained that the downtime appeared to be a regular problem for Standard Bank around the payday period towards the end of the month. “Why always around payday? Are you guys not competent or is your IT outsourced and useless?” a frustrated Twitter user said. “Good Grief! Again?” another on Downdetector stated.
