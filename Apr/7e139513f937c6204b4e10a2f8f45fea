The iStore has opened pre-orders in South Africa for Apple’s AirTags smart trackers, while the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini are now also available in a new purple colour option. The AirTags are Apple’s first low-power smart Bluetooth trackers. Users can attach these small round gadgets to valuable items like keys, wallets, luggage, backpacks, and more. They can then use the Find My app to pinpoint its exact location with precision finding providing the distance and direction to the AirTag. In addition, the AirTag includes a built-in speaker which can be activated through the app in order to find it. When the tracker is not within Bluetooth range, Apple’s Find My network of devices – which includes iPhones from other users – can monitor its location. This could theoretically let users track down stolen or displaced items away from their immediate vicinity. The iStore is offering these AirTags for pre-order at R499 each. Alternatively, buyers could save around a R100 when buying a 4-pack for R1,899. However, this does not include the price of the holders in which the AirTag can be placed for attaching to items. These accessories can be purchased separately and are priced as follows: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-394187 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-accessories-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-accessories-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-accessories-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-accessories-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-accessories-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-accessories-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-accessories.jpg 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The purple iPhone 12 starts at R13,999 for the iPhone 12 Mini 64GB from the iStore.
