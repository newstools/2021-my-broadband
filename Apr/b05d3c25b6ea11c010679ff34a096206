Mobile subscription fraud continues to remain a big problem in South Africa, with almost one in every four carrier transactions in South Africa being fraudulent. This is according to David Lotfi, CEO at anti-fraud cybersecurity firm Evina, who recently spoke to MyBroadband about the state of fraudulent carrier billing in the country. Evina provides telecommunications companies, merchants, and payment gateways with proprietary DCB (Direct Carrier Billing) technology which helps prevent malicious mobile apps from making payments. The firm’s cybersecurity honeypot network, and data retrieved by its cyber threat intelligence observations found that 23.53% of mobile traffic in South Africa was fraudulent in the first quarter of 2021. Lotfi said that the right measures were needed to protect one of the most used payment mediums in Africa’s most advanced economy. “It should be difficult to subscribe mobile users to digital services without their consent, just as it’s difficult today to open a bank account or even obtain a post box without proper consent,” said Lotfi. Mobile fraud is facilitated in a number of ways, including through nefarious applications commonly available on app stores. These include apps which disguise themselves with general features such as flashlights, new wallpapers, pedometer, file manager, and video maker apps. The top 3 most download malicious apps in South Africa all fell under the productivity category. These were PDF Reader, Free Document & PDF Scanner, and Docx Reader. The image below shows a description of each app. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-394527 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-15.51.01-640x325.png" alt="Top 3 malicious apps" width="640" height="325" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-15.51.01-640x325.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-15.51.01-600x305.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-15.51.01-768x390.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-15.51.01-1536x780.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-15.51.01-2048x1040.png 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-15.51.01-1200x610.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In South Africa, however, mobile users continued to be most at risk of a more basic method, called clickjacking. This method tricks the user into clicking on a hidden payment button which is disguised as a different button to the eyes of the user. According to Evina’s latest South Africa Fraud Report, clickjacking made up 76% of the fraud types active in South Africa in Q1 2021. It was followed by spoofing, which accounted for 8.2% of fraudulent transactions. The chart provides a breakdown of the most common ways in which mobile subscription fraud is carried out. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-394509" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-14.41.44-534x430.png" alt="Mobile fraud techniques" width="640" height="516" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-14.41.44-534x430.png 534w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-14.41.44-496x400.png 496w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-14.41.44-768x619.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-14.41.44-1200x967.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-at-14.41.44.png 1482w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Lotfi said that clickjacking was a very basic type of mobile-based fraud that was several years old, and could easily be blocked very quickly by mobile network operators . He called on networks to grasp the bigger picture and the scale on which fraud impacts the entire business and mobile market. “The responsibility of reducing mobile subscription fraud worldwide relies on the MNOs of each country. They are the true dictators of the state of their mobile ecosystem,” Lotfi said. Lotfi advised mobile network operators to partner with a cybersecurity company to clamp down on fraud. He said these companies must posses the following characteristics: Lotfi added that Evina’s software was used in 60 markets across the globe, and secured more than sixteen million transactions per day. One example of this was one major West African network operator with whom the company had worked decreased its fraud rate from 18% to 1%. He added that the use of Evina software had led to a 99.94% decrease in fraudulent transactions detected.
