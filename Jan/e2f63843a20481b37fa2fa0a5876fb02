Despite a sales slump in the global smartphone market in 2020, iPhone units recorded a significant increase in shipments. This is according to data from Digitimes Research, which stated that global smartphone shipments had dropped to 1.24 billion last year – an annual decline of 8.8%. The firm said that the drop was spurred by a massive 20% decline in sales in the first quarter of 2020, followed by another double-digit decline in Q2. These were likely due to widespread COVID-19 lockdowns, which meant that consumers would find it difficult to buy smartphones at physical retailers. Smartphone sales then recovered slightly in the second half of the year, with a single-digit drop in Q3, and then a slight increase in Q4. According to Digitimes Research, the top six smartphone brands in 2020 were as follows: Apple and Xiaomi have the biggest reason to celebrate, however, with both managing to push their sales up 10%. Both Samsung and Huawei saw their shipments drop by double-digits. In addition, 5G smartphone sales climbed to figures of between 280 to 300 million, Digitimes Research claimed. This represented a massive gain over the estimated 20 million units sold in 2019. It is likely that Apple’s impressive performance was buoyed by the sales of its latest flagship – the iPhone 12. Only two weeks after its launch, the iPhone 12 became the world’s best-selling 5G smartphone. This was according to data from Counterpoint Research’s Market Pulse Service, which showed that the new handset had accounted for 16% of all 5G smartphones sold in October 2020. The higher-end iPhone 12 Pro was the second-best seller – with 8% of the market share for that month. Combined, these two smartphones captured a quarter of the total 5G smartphone market during this period.
