The first Dell Technologies TechByte webinar is nearly here – and it is not too late to sign up. This digital transformation webinar will take place on 21 January – so don’t miss out. Digital transformation is a particularly pertinent topic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as organisations have been forced to accelerate their transformation journeys. In fact, the Dell Technologies Digital Transformation Index found that 80% of all businesses implemented transformation programmes last year. This webinar therefore provides tremendous value to C-level executives and IT decision makers. This Dell Technologies TechByte event will feature presentations from various experts, including a keynote address by futurist, economist, and business trends analyst Bronwyn Williams. Dell Technologies System Engineering Director Greg McDonald will be presenting on how digital transformation is a driving force towards business renewal, while Regional Sales Director Sabine Dedering will present alongside Intel on how digital transformation is becoming more accessible to small and medium sized businesses.
