Codehesion is South Africa’s premier smartphone app development company and makes it easy for businesses to build their own Android and iOS apps. With the increase in digital transformation and remote working, most companies are looking to improve their operations through mobile apps. Mobile apps make it possible for companies to improve their communications with clients, create customer loyalty, and give a company a competitive edge. Without a dedicated mobile app, a business will find it increasingly difficult to remain competitive in a world where smartphones dominate.
