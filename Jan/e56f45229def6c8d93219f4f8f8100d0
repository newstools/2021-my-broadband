As the world tries to figure out what the “new normal” might look like, it’s clear that there will be changes and challenges in every facet of life – from work to school to travel and entertainment. No two situations will be the same, no business will be unaffected. Where we work and how we work has been altered. Workspaces will be transformed, and the future of work will be re-imagined. Millions of us have been participating in a global remote working experiment. People cite the top benefit of working remotely is the flexible schedule. Others feel that their top struggle when working remotely is unplugging after work and the blurred lines between work and home. The question we often ask ourselves is; “Have we been working from home or living at work?” The way we used to work, ‘work’ was an office or a place. In this next normal, work is something you do – not a destination & a hybrid workplace will exist between home and the office, with a need to be safe wherever we are and a desire to make sustainable choices. People want to be productive and comfortable at home and the office, but working from only a laptop for 8 hours, day after day, is not sustainable or good for posture. It’s been almost 10 months since people across the world have been sent to work from home. From engaging with distribution all the way to end users, it became abundantly clear that there is strong requirement for users to be set up ergonomically comfortable so they can be productive, safe and healthy. This is simply not a luxury anymore. Creating a comfortable, sustainable way of working will support productivity and user engagement in your business. It’s not where you work, it’s how you work. We like to think of it as equipping users with the right tools for the job. Get the best from your workforce by taking care of their posture and well-being. How do you do this?
