Tesla CEO Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world with a net worth of over $195 billion, slightly higher than Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos on $185 billion. Musk’s rise to the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was the fastest in history, with Musk having started 2020 with a net worth of only $27 billion. This exceptional performance was fuelled by a tremendous rally in Tesla’s share price which surged 743% last year. Musk took over as Tesla CEO in 2008 and helped to take the company public on 29 June 2010 with a share price of $17.00 Tesla shares have gained more than 23,900% since its 2010 initial public offering (IPO). As a 20.7% shareholder in the company, Musk’s wealth grew along with Tesla’s share price. Over the past year, the South Africa-born Musk has added more than $165 billion to his fortune in what is probably the fastest bout of wealth creation in history. Musk, however, does not seem overly interested in topping the rich-list or in accumulating valuable possessions. “You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. I have very little time for recreation. I don’t have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that,” he said. Instead, half of his money is intended to help problems on earth and the other half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. The Mars plans, Musk said, was to ensure the continuation of life in case Earth gets hit by a meteor or World War 3 happens and we destroy ourselves. Last year, Musk also started to sell his real estate, which included numerous mansions in California. He has now moved to Texas, where Tesla and SpaceX have operations, after a disagreement with California state officials over restrictions related to COVID-19. Here is a look at Musk’s long career in the technology industry and how he became the richest man in the world. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-381802"
