January is usually a tough month financially due to all the spending that takes place over the festive season. This has been amplified by the national lockdown, which has forced South Africans to tighten their belts. This priority of saving money is why Axxess’s exciting new Fixed LTE promotion is perfect for anyone who needs affordable Internet connectivity. If you sign up to MTN Fixed LTE through Axxess today, you will receive free once-off bonus data that is equal to the monthly data allocation of your package. For example, if you sign up for a 50GB per month Fixed LTE package, you will get an additional 50GB once-off for free.
