There is a wide variety of entry-level Windows 10 laptops in the South African market priced at less than R5,000. These computers may not have the powerful hardware, sleek metal bodies, or narrow screen bezels found in the premium segment, but they should be more than capable enough for less demanding use-cases. Users who need to access programs and applications that perform basic computing tasks – which could include word and spreadsheet processing, reading emails, browsing the web, listening to music, and streaming video – will likely be satisfied with a budget laptop. Add the advantage of mobility and an all-in-one package and it makes for an even more attractive option. However, to ensure reliable performance, it is recommended that the laptop meet the minimum requirements for Windows 10 as set out by Microsoft. These are as follows: We assembled a list of 10 of the cheapest laptops which ship with Windows 10, meet the above requirements, and can be purchased from online stores in South Africa. The cheapest model we found was a 14-inch laptop from an obscure company called Connex which was priced at R2,999 at HiFi Corp. While there were a number of other obscure brands in our compilation, there were also laptops from well-known manufacturers including ASUS, Lenovo, and Mecer. Most of the machines featured Intel’s Celeron and Atom processor, although one entry did come with a budget offering from AMD. We specifically excluded any refurbished models from our list. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-379696"
