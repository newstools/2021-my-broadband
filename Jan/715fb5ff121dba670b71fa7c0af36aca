Apple Inc. led shares of the largest technology companies lower in the first trading day of the year, suffering its worst decline in more than a month amid a broad market sell-off. Shares of the iPhone maker fell as much as 4.5% on Monday before recovering some of the losses to close down 2.5% at $129.41. The decline was the biggest since Nov. 23. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. both fell more than 2%, compared with a 1.5% decline in the S&P 500 Index. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-381510" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-Year-Slump-640x359.jpg" alt="New Year Slump" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-Year-Slump-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-Year-Slump-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-Year-Slump-768x431.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-Year-Slump.jpg 814w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The U.S. equity market sank on Monday after ending 2020 at an all-time high. Technology megacaps including Apple and Amazon, which were among the top performers last year, were particularly hard hit in the sell-off, which was driven by concern that a surge in coronavirus cases could crimp the nascent economic recovery. Apple was the best performing-stock in the group in 2020 after growing optimism about device and services sales helped fuel a December surge that cemented its lead over Amazon with an 81% gain. Amazon ended the year with a 76% gain.
