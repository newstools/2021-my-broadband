Bitcoin rose to $37,000 on Monday, back toward a level that strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. see as an inflection point for the digital coin. The cryptocurrency could be hurt by an exodus of trend-following investors unless it can “break out” above $40,000 soon, a team including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said. The pattern of demand for Bitcoin futures and the $22.9 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust will help determine the outlook, they added. “The flow into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust would likely need to sustain its $100 million per day pace over the coming days and weeks for such a breakout to occur,” the strategists wrote in a note on Friday. Traders seeking clues about investor appetite for risk have been gripped by Bitcoin’s stunning rally and turbulent 12% slide from a record of almost $42,000 on Jan. 8. The cryptocurrency boom since March has reflected the ebullience of financial markets awash in stimulus — as well as concern over whether gains will ultimately prove fleeting. The JPMorgan strategists said Bitcoin was in a similar position in late November, except with $20,000 as the test. Flows of institutional investment into the Grayscale trust helped the world’s largest cryptocurrency extend its rally, they wrote. Trend-following traders “could propagate the past week’s correction” and “momentum signals will naturally decay from here up till the end of March” if Bitcoin’s price fails to break above $40,000, they said. Bitcoin rose about 1.6% to $37,138 as of 12:29 p.m. in London on Monday. Ether, another popular digital coin, shed 1.6% to $1,241. Exactly what’s driven the yearlong near-quadrupling in Bitcoin’s price remains murky. Commentators have cited day traders, wealthy buyers, hedge funds, companies and even signs of interest from long-term investors like insurers. Some, like Chris Iggo, remain skeptical of Bitcoin’s appeal to large institutions. “I dread to think what most risk officers would think about that being in a core investment portfolio,” the chief investment officer of core investments at Axa Investment Managers wrote in a note. “For assets to be considered in a long-term investment portfolio one should be able to attach some fundamental intrinsic value to them.” Bitcoin’s proponents argue it’s maturing as a hedge for dollar weakness and the possibility of faster inflation in a recovering global economy. Others say its defining characteristic remains speculative booms followed by busts. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-383264" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bitcoin-recovery-January-2021-640x359.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bitcoin-recovery-January-2021-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bitcoin-recovery-January-2021-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bitcoin-recovery-January-2021-768x431.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bitcoin-recovery-January-2021.jpg 814w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
