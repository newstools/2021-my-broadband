According to the IDC, the global smartphone market is slated for a major decline in sales in 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With its severe consequences on people’s livelihoods, the outbreak has wounded flagship smartphone sales. Nevertheless, the demand for connectivity remained, and low and mid-range smartphones have seen significant growth. In the second quarter of 2020, devices priced between $100 (R1,500) and $400 (R6,000) accounted for 60% of total global smartphone shipments. The IDC explained that there continued to be a strong shift towards these devices in developing regions in particular, where they make up over 80% of smartphone volumes. The organisation predicted that this share would continue to increase in 2021. Mid-range smartphones have become great options for many due to offering a balance of pricing and features that are satisfactory for the majority of typical smartphone users. Samsung has been a major player in this segment, with its Galaxy A series devices being notably popular. The A51 has had a great year in particular, with 11.4 million units sold in the first half of 2020 alone, making it the top-selling Android smartphone for that period and the second-best of all smartphones. For the third quarter of the year, Apple’s mid-range iPhone SE claimed that spot, with 10 million units shipped. Aside from these noteworthy contenders, South Africa’s mid-range smartphone market is booming with a wide variety of options between R5,000 and R10,000 from multiple manufacturers. Below are six of the best mid-range smartphones released in 2020 that you can buy for under R10,000 in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-380436" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple-iPhone-SE-2020.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-380438" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Huawei-P40-Lite-5G-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Huawei-P40-Lite-5G.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Huawei-P40-Lite-5G-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Huawei-P40-Lite-5G-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-380446" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Oppo-A72-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Oppo-A72.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Oppo-A72-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Oppo-A72-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-380448" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-A51-new-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-A51-new.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-A51-new-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-A51-new-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-380442" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Lite.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-380444" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-9-Pro-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-9-Pro.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-9-Pro-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-9-Pro-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
