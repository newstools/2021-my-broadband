Supersonic has extended its home broadband deals, with big price cuts on fixed-LTE packages until the end of January. These fixed-LTE products are offered over MTN’s award-winning network which guarantees excellent speeds and great reliability. Supersonic is offering two home broadband deals: Good news is that both these deals are available on a month-to-month basis, which means no long-term contracts. Users who sign up for these packages will also get a free-to-use LTE router that they can use for as long as the service remains active. Further good news is that Supersonic is running a fibre promotion for people who order a new connection. While new subscribers are waiting for their fibre to be installed, Supersonic will provide them with a free uncapped LTE package. This means you will be connected from the time you order your fibre to the time it is active.
