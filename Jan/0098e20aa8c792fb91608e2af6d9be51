The Department of Sports, Arts and Culture has gazetted the new guidelines for the sector under the latest adjusted lockdown level 3. The guidelines detail what gyms, fitness centres and other sporting facilities need to have in place to continue operating. The latest set of regulations follow the general guidelines set out by Cogta minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma last week, which includes mandatory mask-wearing and limits on the number of people venues can hold. However, they also include specifics for gyms and fitness centres, which are allowed to remain open under lockdown. This is unlike sports grounds and fields, which are closed to the public for the two week period ending 15 January 2021, as well as all beaches, dams, lakes, rivers and the associated recreational facilities at these places in hotspot areas in the country. According to the department all beaches not closed to the public, as well as fitness centres, gyms, cinemas, theatres and museums will need to control access and keep sanitising products available â€“ while people visiting these areas will have to wear masks. For exercise taking place outdoors, previous regulations have already stated that masks need to be worn in public places, unless doing vigorous exercise. The same regulation of two metres distance between people in these spaces applies. In line with the national regulations, the following is also in effect: The full regulations are linked below: Sports and Fitness Level 3 Jan 2021
